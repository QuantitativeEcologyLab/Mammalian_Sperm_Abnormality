Title = {Case Studies in Polar Bear (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) Sperm Collection and
   Cryopreservation Techniques},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Polar bears are threatened by habitat loss, decreased
   food availability, and reduced reproductive success due to climate
   change. Zoo populations can support species survival through
   preservation of genetic diversity and maintenance of insurance
   populations, but in the US, the zoo polar bear population is currently
   not sustainable. The development of sperm collection and
   cryopreservation can help to support the population by providing the
   biomaterial needed for assisted reproductive techniques, such as
   artificial insemination. However, these procedures are not well
   described for polar bears. Data from 38 opportunistic sperm collections,
   that were conducted between 2011 and 2021, were assessed to establish
   best practices to date for collecting and preserving polar bear sperm.
   The information gathered demonstrates that urethral catheterization is
   an efficient method of sperm collection, sperm can be rescued postmortem
   from the vasa deferentia and epididymides, and polar bear sperm
   collection appears to be most effective during the breeding season.
   Furthermore, polar bear sperm can survive cryopreservation. Further
   studies will optimize these techniques, but this summary provides
   information that is immediately applicable to enhancing sample
   collection and cryopreservation success that could support the long-term
   genetic management of polar bears in zoos. Assisted reproductive
   technologies can aid conservation efforts via support of ex situ
   population management and preservation of genetic material. Data from 38
   sperm collection attempts from 17 polar bears (1-5 procedures/bear) were
   evaluated. Sample collections were attempted via electroejaculation
   (EEJ; n = 6), urethral catheterization (UC; n = 25), or sperm rescue
   (SR; n = 7) during the breeding season (Jan. 1-May 21; n = 27) and
   nonbreeding season (May 22-Dec. 31; n = 11). Sperm retrieval was
   successful in 1 EEJ (16.7\%), 18 UC (72.0\%) and 4 SR (57.1\%)
   collections. Initial sperm motility and viability were 50.0\% and 77.0\%
   for EEJ, 64.3 +/- 7.4\% and 80.9 +/- 3.8\% for UC, and 56.7 +/- 8.8\%
   and 80.5 +/- 0.5\% for SR. UC and SR were more likely to be successful
   during the breeding season (84.2-100\%) than the nonbreeding season
   (25.0-33.3\%). Testicular tumors were observed in four males (57\%)
   during SR. In total, 13 samples were cryopreserved (n = 1 EEJ, 9 UC, and
   3 SR) with egg-yolk-based equine extender (EQ) or OptiXcell (OP). For
   both extenders, post-thaw motility and viability were reduced by 20-60\%
   and 30-65\%, respectively. Further efforts to optimize procedures are
   warranted, but this summary provides data useful for enhancing the
   success of polar bear sperm collection and cryopreservation.},

Abstract = {Climate-induced sea-ice loss represents the greatest threat to polar
   bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774), and utilizing drones to
   characterize behavioural responses to sea-ice loss is valuable for
   forecasting polar bear persistence. In this manuscript, we review
   previously published literature and draw on our own experience of using
   multirotor aerial drones to study polar bear behaviour in the Canadian
   Arctic. Specifically, we suggest that drones can minimize human-bear
   conflicts by allowing users to observe bears from a safe vantage point;
   produce high-quality behavioural data that can be reviewed as many times
   as needed and shared with multiple stakeholders; and foster knowledge
   generation through co-production with northern communities. We posit
   that in some instances drones may be considered as an alternative tool
   for studying polar bear foraging behaviour, interspecific interactions,
   human-bear interactions, human safety and conflict mitigation, and
   den-site location at individual-level small spatial scales. Finally, we
   discuss flying techniques to ensure ethical operation around polar
   bears, regulatory requirements to consider, and recommend that future
   research focus on understanding polar bears' behavioural and
   physiological responses to drones and the efficacy of drones as a
   deterrent tool for safety purposes.},

Abstract = {In 2008, polar bears were listed as a species threatened with extinction
   by the U. S. Endangered Species Act. Unfortunately, reproductive success
   has been poor despite breeding recommendations for almost every
   reproductively viable bear by the Species Survival Plant. Assisted
   reproductive technologies could complement breeding efforts by
   overcoming the challenges of behavioral incompatibilities and
   deficiencies, facilitating genetic management and increasing cub
   production. The goal of this study was to artificially inseminate a
   female polar bear after inducing ovarian activity and ovulation with
   exogenous hormones (equine chorionic gonadotropin and porcine
   luteinizing hormone). Fresh semen collected from an adult male via
   electroejaculation/urethral catheterization was used for the
   insemination. Fecal steroid monitoring indicated that the female
   ovulated following the exogenous hormone treatment. Progestin
   concentrations increased in late summer, at the time implantation was
   expected to occur; however, no cubs were produced. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of ovulation induction and
   artificial insemination in a polar bear.},

Title = {Predatory cue use in flush responses of a colonial nesting seabird
   during polar bear foraging},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {193},
Pages = {75-90},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nest predation is a primary cause of reproductive failure in birds;
   thus, predators apply strong selective pressure on nesting behaviour,
   especially risk assessment behaviours during predator encounters at
   nests. Prey's risk assessments are not static; rather, dynamic risk
   assessment theory predicts that prey assess risk in real-time and update
   it according to changes in cues posed by the predator(s). We used drone
   videography to film nest-flushing behaviours of common eiders, Somateria
   mollissima, in response to foraging polar bears, Ursus maritimus, on
   East Bay Island (Nunavut, Canada). We assessed how cue use influenced
   flushing behaviour and nest fate in a path analysis using 200
   observations of 193 eiders in 2017. Our most supported model found that
   more direct angles of visual gaze and travel angle by polar bears
   resulted in conspicuous nest flushes by eiders (0 =-0.236 +/- 0.059),
   whereas the presence of herring gulls, Larus argentatus, resulted in
   more discrete flushes of hens walking from their nests (0 =-0.181 +/-
   0.059). Shorter flush initiation distances between eiders and
   approaching bears resulted in greater nest predation by polar bears (0
   =-0.203 +/- 0.076). We found no support that an eider's visibility from
   the nest influenced any component of flushing behaviour. We suggest that
   during encounters with bears, eiders are capable of assessing risk and
   making appropriate behavioural decisions to reduce the chances of nest
   loss. However, as the colony experienced heavy predation by bears in
   2017, behavioural responses alone appear to be insufficient to mitigate
   polar bear predation at the population level. (c) 2022 The Association

Title = {Polar bear foraging on common eider eggs: estimating the energetic
   consequences of a climate-mediated behavioural shift},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {63-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate-mediated phenological shifts can cause species to lose access to
   their primary prey while increasing opportunities for alternative-prey
   encounters. Species that are able to capitalize on alternative resources
   could potentially profit from prey-switching should the benefits of
   procuring these alternative resources outweigh their acquisition costs.
   Polar bears, Ursus maritimus, use sea ice as a platform to hunt seals,
   and individuals inhabiting the southern-most extent of their range rely
   on accumulated fat reserves to sustain themselves during the
   increasingly lengthy ice-free season. In response to declining access to
   their primary prey through documented sea ice loss, some polar bears are
   foraging on the eggs of birds in lieu of hunting opportunities on ice,
   as their onshore arrival is increasingly overlapping with birds'
   breeding schedules. To gain a better understanding of the energetic
   consequences of this behaviour, we used aerial drones to record polar
   bears foraging on sea duck eggs (common eider, Somateria mollissima) on
   Mitivik Island, Nunavut, Canada. Using these data, we examined variation
   in individual polar bear foraging behaviours and estimated the energetic
   benefits and costs associated with foraging on common eider eggs.
   Because of low costs associated with nest searching and consumption, the
   energetic cost of foraging remained relatively constant throughout the
   2-week observation period. However, we found that as the common eider
   breeding season progressed, polar bears consumed eggs at a lower rate as
   they depleted the nesting colony and spent proportionally more time
   searching for nests. Collectively, this foraging pattern led to an
   overall declining trend in the net energy gained from egg consumption.
   Foraging on common eider eggs during increasingly lengthy ice-free
   seasons is apparently beneficial for polar bears, but only during a
   limited window of opportunity. By coupling energetic estimates with
   detailed behavioural data collected through aerial videography, this
   study provides a quantification of both the benefits and costs of egg
   consumption for polar bears. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of

Title = {Age and seasonal variation in testis and baculum morphology in East
   Greenland polar bears (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) in relation to high
   concentrations of persistent organic pollutants},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {173},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are found in high concentrations in
   the Artic. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are one of the most exposed
   mammals in the Arctic and are thereby vulnerable to reproductive
   disruption. The aim of this study was to investigate male polar bear
   reproduction based on a detailed evaluation of testis histology and to
   assess possible effects of environmental chemicals on male polar bear
   reproduction. Reproductive groups that were identified based on
   histology were as follows: actively reproductive (REP), non-reproductive
   either with degenerated testes (DEG), undeveloped seminiferous tubules
   (UND), or morphology in-transition (INT). Categorization into these
   groups was supported by significant differences in testis and baculum
   measurements among REP, DEG, and UND, as well as differences in the area
   and diameter of seminiferous tubules among REP, DEG, and UND. These
   results show that it is possible to identify the reproductive stage in
   polar bears even if capture date and or age is lacking. Based on testis
   morphology we suggest that adult male polar bears from East Greenland
   have active spermatogenesis in February to June, and inactive
   degenerated testes in August to January. January to February was the
   main period of reproductive transition, characterised by a shift between
   inactive and active spermatogenesis. Baculum and testis size
   measurements decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of
   the chlordane metabolite oxychlordane, suggesting a potential impact on
   male reproductive success. Half of the investigated polar bears in REP
   group displayed signs of disorganization of the spermatogenesis which
   might be a sign of disrupted reproduction. However, no correlations with
   levels of the investigated POPs were detected. Reproductive organ
   measurements in polar bears differed significantly between REP and DEG
   groups, which cannot be explained by age, and therefore should be
   considered when investigating the effect of POPs on male reproduction.},

Abstract = {Reproductive organs from 55 male and 44 female East Greenland polar
   bears were examined to investigate the potential negative impact from
   organohalogen pollutants (OHCs). Multiple regressions normalizing for
   age showed a significant inverse relationship between OHCs and testis
   length and baculum length and weight, respectively, and was found in
   both subadults (dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethanes, dieldrin, chlordanes,
   hexacyclohexanes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)) and adults (hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB]) (all p <
   0.05). Baculum bone mineral densities decreased with increasing
   chlordanes, DDTs, and HCB in subadults and adults, respectively (all p <
   0.05). In females, a significant inverse relationship was found between
   ovary length and Sigma PCB (p = 0.03) and Sigma CHL (p < 0.01),
   respectively, and between ovary weight and T PBDE (p < 0.01) and uterine
   horn length and HCB (p = 0.02). The study suggests that there is an
   impact from xenoendocrine pollutants on the size of East Greenland polar
   bear genitalia. This may pose a risk to this polar bear subpopulation in
   the future because of reduced sperm and egg quality/quantity and uterus
   and penis size/robustness.},

Abstract = {Age at sexual maturity among male polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and
   timing of the mating season were studied by microscopic and macroscopic
   analysis of the reproductive organs from 165 male and 92 female
   Greenland polar bears. Males became sexually mature in the spring
   following their fifth birthday. Testes sampled during the spring reached
   95\% of their asymptotic length at 5.8 years. Some spermatozoa were
   found in 2- to 4-year-old bears during the spring, but only in low
   concentrations in a mixture of other cell types. The first corpus luteum
   was found on 1 April and most ovulations were estimated to occur before
   mid-May which indicate that the peak of the mating season begins in late
   March and ends in May. These findings are somewhat different from a
   similar study from Svalbard, where the mating season is estimated to
   peak later and male polar bears are found to become mature earlier. We
   hypothesize that these differences occur because adolescent males have
   their peak testicular activity after the main breeding period and
   therefore appear to be fully sexually mature during summer and not
   during spring.},

Journal = {ARCTIC SCIENCE},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {114-123},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Contemporary climate change is predicted to expose some species to
   altered predation regimes. Losses of Arctic sea ice are causing polar
   bears to increasingly forage on colonial seaduck eggs in lieu of
   ice-based hunting of marine mammals. Although polar bear predation of
   bird eggs has now been widely documented, it is unclear whether this
   change in predator behavior is having population-level consequences for
   Arctic breeding birds. In this study, we tested whether changes in the
   number of common eider nests on 76 islands in Hudson Strait, Canada,
   were related to variation in polar bear presence. We found that polar
   bear sign detected during eider breeding surveys was strongly correlated
   with spatial patterns of polar bears observed during aerial surveys.
   However, changes in eider nest count did not appear to be clearly
   related to polar bear sign at either the island scale or the
   island-cluster scale. This results of this study, therefore, suggest
   that the spatial overlap between eiders and polar bears varies across
   the landscape, but patterns of polar bear spatial variation do not seem
   to have driven large-scale redistribution of nesting common eiders.},

Title = {Increasing nest predation will be insufficient to maintain polar bear
   body condition in the face of sea ice loss},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Climate change can influence interspecific interactions by
   differentially affecting species-specific phenology. In seasonal ice
   environments, there is evidence that polar bear predation of Arctic bird
   eggs is increasing because of earlier sea ice breakup, which forces
   polar bears into nearshore terrestrial environments where Arctic birds
   are nesting. Because polar bears can consume a large number of nests
   before becoming satiated, and because they can swim between island
   colonies, they could have dramatic influences on seabird and sea duck
   reproductive success. However, it is unclear whether nest foraging can
   provide an energetic benefit to polar bear populations, especially given
   the capacity of bird populations to redistribute in response to
   increasing predation pressure. In this study, we develop a spatially
   explicit agent-based model of the predator-prey relationship between
   polar bears and common eiders, a common and culturally important bird
   species for northern peoples. Our model is composed of two types of
   agents (polar bear agents and common eider hen agents) whose movements
   and decision heuristics are based on species-specific bioenergetic and
   behavioral ecological principles, and are influenced by historical and
   extrapolated sea ice conditions. Our model reproduces empirical findings
   that polar bear predation of bird nests is increasing and predicts an
   accelerating relationship between advancing ice breakup dates and the
   number of nests depredated. Despite increases in nest predation, our
   model predicts that polar bear body condition during the ice-free period
   will continue to decline. Finally, our model predicts that common eider
   nests will become more dispersed and will move closer to the mainland in
   response to increasing predation, possibly increasing their exposure to
   land-based predators and influencing the livelihood of local people that
   collect eider eggs and down. These results show that predatorprey
   interactions can have nonlinear responses to changes in climate and
   provides important predictions of ecological change in Arctic
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Predator-prey dynamics in the Arctic are being altered with changing sea
   ice phenology. The increasing frequency of predation on colonial nesting
   seabirds and their eggs by the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a
   consequence of bears shifting to terrestrial food resources through a
   shortened seal-hunting season. We examined antipredator responses in a
   colony of nesting Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) on East Bay
   Island, Nunavut, Canada, which is exposed to established nest predators,
   such as arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), but also to recent increases in
   polar bear nest predation due to the bears' lost on-ice hunting
   opportunities. Given eiders' limited eco-evolutionary experience with
   bears, we aimed to experimentally contrast eider responses to the recent
   predation pressure by polar bears to those induced by their more
   traditional mammalian predator, the arctic fox. Our goal was to
   characterize whether this population of eiders was vulnerable to a
   changing predator regime. Using simulated approaches of visual stimuli
   of both predator types, we measured eider heart rate and flight
   initiation distance as physiological and behavioral metrics,
   respectively, to characterize the perceived risk of and subsequent
   response to imminent threat posed by these two predators that differ in
   historical encounter rates. Eider heart rates were more responsive to
   impending visual cues of arctic foxes compared to polar bears, but birds
   responded behaviorally to all simulated threats with similar flight
   initiation distances. Results suggest eiders may not perceive the full
   risk that bears pose as egg and adult predators, and are therefore
   expected to suffer negative fitness consequences from this ongoing and
   increasing interaction. Eiders may therefore require conservation
   intervention to aid in their management.},

Title = {Allee effect in polar bears: a potential consequence of polychlorinated
   biphenyl contamination},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {283},

Abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from East Greenland and Svalbard exhibited
   very high concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the
   1980s and 1990s. In Svalbard, slow population growth during that period
   was suspected to be linked to PCB contamination. In this case study, we
   explored how PCBs could have impacted polar bear population growth
   and/or male reproductive success in Svalbard during the mid-1990s by
   reducing the fertility of contaminated males. A dose-response
   relationship linking the effects of PCBs to male polar bear fertility
   was extrapolated from studies of the effects of PCBs on spermquality in
   rodents. Based on this relationship, an individual-based model of bear
   interactions during the breeding season predicted fertilization success
   under alternative assumptions regarding male-male competition for
   females. Contamination reduced pregnancy rates by decreasing the
   availability of fertile males, thus triggering amate-finding Allee
   effect, particularly when male-male competition for females was limited
   or when infertile males were able to compete with fertile males for
   females. Comparisons of our model predictions on age-dependent
   reproductive success of males with published empirical observations
   revealed that the low representation of 10-14-year-old males among
   breeding males documented in Svalbard in mid-1990s could have resulted
   from PCB contamination. We conclude that contamination-related male
   infertility may lead to a reduction in population growth via an Allee
   effect. The magnitude of the effect is largely dependent on the
   population-specific mating system. In eco-toxicological risk
   assessments, appropriate consideration should therefore be given to
   negative effects of contaminants on male fertility and male mating
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {Environmental change and increasing levels of human activity are threats
   to marine mammals in the Arctic. Identifying marine mammal hotspots and
   areas of high species richness are essential to help guide management
   and conservation efforts. Herein, space use based on biotelemetric

   individuals) in the Greenland and northern Barents Seas between 2005 and
   2018 is reported. Getis-Ord G(1){*} hotspots were calculated for each
   species as well as all species combined, and areas of high species
   richness were identified for summer/autumn (Jun-Dec), winter/spring
   (Jan- May) and the entire year. The marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the
   Greenland Sea and northern Barents Sea, the waters surrounding the
   Svalbard Archipelago and a few Northeast Greenland coastal sites were
   identified as key marine mammal hotspots and areas of high species
   richness in this region. Individual hotspots identified areas important
   for most of the tagged animals, such as common resting, nursing,
   moulting and foraging areas. Location hotspots identified areas heavily
   used by segments of the tagged populations, including denning areas for
   polar bears and foraging areas. The hotspots identified herein are also
   important habitats for seabirds and fishes, and thus conservation and
   management measures targeting these regions would benefit multiple
   groups of Arctic animals.},

Title = {Bear presence attracts avian predators but does not impact lesser snow

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The presence of foraging bears in Arctic breeding bird colonies has been
   increasingly reported in the literature, and these may constitute
   disturbance events which cause incubating birds to leave their nest.
   Avian predators may associate with bears during such events, likely to
   capitalize on unattended nests in the presence of bears. Here, we
   estimated changes in daily nest attendance of lesser snow geese Anser
   caerulescens caerulescens in the presence of foraging bears, and
   estimated the association between foraging bears and avian predators. We
   predicted decreased nest attendance by geese on days with bears, and
   close associations between avian predators and bears. We monitored snow
   goose nests with cameras from 2013 to 2018 to assess nest attendance
   behaviours on days when bears were in the colony compared to control
   days without bears. When bears were present in colonies, we estimated
   the probability of avian predator occurrence compared to control
   periods. When controlling for day of incubation and camera placement
   types, we found no significant effects of bears on daily nest attendance
   behaviours of snow geese (n = 85). We found a significantly higher
   probability of observing avian predators when bears were present (0.72)
   compared to control periods without bears (0.11). We show that snow
   geese do not alter daily nest attendance in the presence of foraging
   bears, and suggest this is due to the presence of avian predators.},

Abstract = {In a clinical survey on East Greenland male sledge dogs (Canis
   familiaris), one dog exhibited malformation of the external genital
   organs. The clinically in situ examination of the sledge dog revealed a
   rare congenital malformation of the urethra and penis corresponding to
   severe perineal and penile hypospadias. The testes showed spermiogenesis
   and no sign of true hermaphroditism. We did not have the opportunity to
   examine the dam for endocrine organ pathology or tumours. But, based on
   organochlorine data in ringed sea] (Phoca hispida) blubber and
   information from the owners, the potential in uteri OC exposure of the
   sledge dog was estimated to 320 mu g/day which correspond to 128 pg
   TEQ/kg/day. This is 32-128-folds above WHO guidelines and threshold
   levels for teratogen and reproductive effects. We suggest that the
   congenital malformation was due to endocrine organ pathology/tumours of
   the dam, enzyme/ receptor defects (mutation) in the pup or in uteri
   exposure to environmental xenoestrogens. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Climate-mediated sea-ice loss is disrupting the foraging ecology of
   polar bears (Ursus maritimus) across much of their range. As a result,
   there have been increased reports of polar bears foraging on seabird
   eggs across parts of their range. Given that polar bears have evolved to
   hunt seals on ice, they may not be efficient predators of seabird eggs.
   We investigated polar bears' foraging performance on common eider
   (Somateria mollissima) eggs on Mitivik Island, Nunavut, Canada to test
   whether bear decision-making heuristics are consistent with expectations
   of optimal foraging theory. Using aerial-drones, we recorded multiple
   foraging bouts over 11 days, and found that as clutches were depleted to
   completion, bears did not exhibit foraging behaviours matched to
   resource density. As the season progressed, bears visited fewer nests
   overall, but marginally increased their visitation to nests that were
   already empty. Bears did not display different movement modes related to
   nest density, but became less selective in their choice of clutches to
   consume. Lastly, bears that capitalized on visual cues of flushing eider
   hens significantly increased the number of clutches they consumed;
   however, they did not use this strategy consistently or universally. The
   foraging behaviours exhibited by polar bears in this study suggest they
   are inefficient predators of seabird eggs, particularly in the context
   of matching behaviours to resource density.},

   tularensis antibodies in a diverse suite of taxa, including insects,
   birds, and mammals. However, few such investigations have been conducted
   recently and knowledge about the current distribution and disease
   ecology of F. tularensis is limited, particularly in Arctic Alaska, an
   area undergoing rapid environmental changes from climate warming. To
   help address these information gaps and provide insights about patterns
   of exposure among wildlife, we assessed the seroprevalence of P.
   tularensis antibodies in mammals and tundra-nesting geese from the
   Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, 2014-17. With a commercially available
   slide agglutination test, we detected antibodies in 14.7\% of all
   individuals sampled (n=722), with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:320. We
   detected significant differences in seroprevalence between family
   groups, with Canidae (foxes, Vulpes spp.) and Sciuridae (Arctic ground
   squirrel, Spermophilus parryii) having the highest seroprevalence at
   21.5\% and 33.3\%, respectively. Mean seroprevalence for Ursidae (polar
   bears, Ursus maritimus) was 13.3\%, whereas Cervidae (caribou, Rangifer
   tarandus) had comparatively low seroprevalence at 6.5\%. Antibodies were
   detected in all Anatidae species sampled, with Black Brant (Branta
   berniela nigricans) having the highest seroprevalence at 13.6\%. The
   detection of F. tularensis antibodies across multiple taxa from the
   Arctic Coastal Plain and its nearshore marine region provides evidence
   of exposure to this pathogen throughout the region and highlights the
   need for renewed surveillance in Alaska.},

Abstract = {Aim Identify hotspots and areas of high species richness for Arctic
   marine mammals. Location Circumpolar Arctic. Methods A total of 2115
   biologging devices were deployed on marine mammals from 13 species in
   the Arctic from 2005 to 2019. Getis-Ord G(i){*} hotspots were calculated
   based on the number of individuals in grid cells for each species and
   for phylogenetic groups (nine pinnipeds, three cetaceans, all species)
   and areas with high species richness were identified for summer
   (Jun-Nov), winter (Dec-May) and the entire year. Seasonal habitat
   differences among species' hotspots were investigated using Principal
   Component Analysis. Results Hotspots and areas with high species
   richness occurred within the Arctic continental-shelf seas and within
   the marginal ice zone, particularly in the ``Arctic gateways{''} of the
   north Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Summer hotspots were generally found
   further north than winter hotspots, but there were exceptions to this
   pattern, including bowhead whales in the Greenland-Barents Seas and
   species with coastal distributions in Svalbard, Norway and East
   Greenland. Areas with high species richness generally overlapped
   high-density hotspots. Large regional and seasonal differences in
   habitat features of hotspots were found among species but also within
   species from different regions. Gap analysis (discrepancy between
   hotspots and IUCN ranges) identified species and regions where more
   research is required. Main conclusions This study identified important
   areas (and habitat types) for Arctic marine mammals using available
   biotelemetry data. The results herein serve as a benchmark to measure
   future distributional shifts. Expanded monitoring and telemetry studies
   are needed on Arctic species to understand the impacts of climate change
   and concomitant ecosystem changes (synergistic effects of multiple
   stressors). While efforts should be made to fill knowledge gaps,
   including regional gaps and more complete sex and age coverage, hotspots
   identified herein can inform management efforts to mitigate the impacts
   of human activities and ecological changes, including creation of
   protected areas.},

Abstract = {The zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular envelope that surrounds
   mammalian oocytes. This coat participates in the interaction between
   gametes, induction of the acrosome reaction, block of polyspermy and
   protection of the oviductal embryo. Previous studies suggested that
   carnivore ZP was formed by three glycoproteins (ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4), with
   ZP1 being a pseudogene. However, a recent study in the cat found that
   all four proteins were expressed. In the present study, in silico and
   molecular analyses were performed in several carnivores to clarify the
   ZP composition in this order of mammals. The in silico analysis
   demonstrated the presence of the ZP1 gene in five carnivores: cheetah,
   panda, polar bear, tiger and walrus, whereas in the Antarctic fur seal
   and the Weddell seal there was evidence of pseudogenisation. Molecular
   analysis showed the presence of four ZP transcripts in ferret ovaries
   (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4) and three in fox ovaries (ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4).
   Analysis of the fox ZP1 gene showed the presence of a stop codon. The
   results strongly suggest that all four ZP genes are expressed in most
   carnivores, whereas ZP1 pseudogenisation seems to have independently
   affected three families (Canidae, Otariidae and Phocidae) of the
   carnivore tree.},

Title = {Niches of marine mammals in the European Arctic},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Arctic is warming rapidly, with concomitant sea ice losses and
   ecosystem changes. The animals most vulnerable to Arctic food web
   changes are long-lived and slow-growing such as marine mammals, which
   may not be able to adapt rapidly enough to respond to changes in their
   resource bases. To determine the current extent and sources of these
   resource bases, we examined isotopic and trophic niches for marine
   mammals in the European Arctic using skin carbon (delta C-13) and
   nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope (SI) compositions from 10 species:
   blue, fin, humpback, minke, sperm and white whales, bearded and ringed
   seals, walruses and polar bears, and dietary fatty acids (FAs) in polar
   bears, walruses and most of the whale species listed here. SI values
   showed clear species separation by trophic behaviour and carbon sources.
   Bearded seals, walruses and white whales had the smallest isotopic
   niches; these species are all resident High Arctic species and are
   likely to be particularly vulnerable to changes in Arctic ecosystems. We
   found clear separation between FA groupings driven by pelagic, benthic
   and planktonic/algal sources: pelagic FAs in all whales, benthic FAs in
   walruses, and copepod/algae/ dinoflagellate FAs in polar bears, with
   some polar bear compositions approaching those of the whales and
   walruses. There is strong niche partitioning between study species with
   minimal functional redundancy, which could impact Arctic ecosystem
   structure and connectivity if populations of these large nutrient
   vectors are reduced or lost.},

Abstract = {In this study, we determined the residue levels and patterns of
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) in the
   blood from eight species of toothed whales and three species of baleen
   whales stranded along the Japanese coast during 1999-2007. Penta-
   through hepta-chlorinated PCB congeners were the dominant homologue
   groups in all cetaceans. In contrast, specific differences in the
   distribution of dominant OH-PCB isomers and homologues were found among
   the cetacean species. In five species of toothed whales (melon-headed
   whale, Stejneger's beaked whale, Pacific white-sided dolphin,
   Blainville's beaked whale, and killer whale), the predominant homologues
   were OH-penta-PCBs followed by OH-tetra-PCBs and OH-tri-PCBs. The
   predominant homologues of finless porpoise and beluga whale were
   OH-penta-PCBs followed by OH-hexa-PCBs and OH-tri-PCBs. The predominant
   OH-PCB isomers were para-OH-PCBs such as 4'OH-CB26,
   4'OH-CB25/4'OH-CB26/4OH-CB31, 4OH-CB70, 4'OH-CB72, 4'OH-CB97,
   4'OH-CB101/4'OH-CB120, and 4OH-CB107/4'OH-CB108 in toothed whales. In
   three baleen whales (common minke whale, Bryde's whale, and humpback
   whale) and in sperm whale (which is a toothed whale), OH-octa-PCB
   (4OH-CB202) was the predominant homologue group accounting for 40-80\%
   of the total OH-PCB concentrations. The differences in concentrations
   and profiles of OH-PCBs may suggest species-specific diets, metabolic
   capability, and the transthyretin (TTR) binding specificity. These
   results reveal that the accumulation profiles of OH-PCBs in cetacean
   blood are entirely different from the profiles found in pinnipeds, polar
   bear, and humans.},

Title = {Biomonitoring in Greenland: human biomarkers of exposure and effects - a
   short review},
Journal = {RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Context: Since 1997 the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme
   (AMAP) has produced integrated assessment reports on the status of and
   trends in environmental persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the
   Arctic ecosystem. Three reports on biomonitoring POPs and their health
   risks for Arctic populations were published in 1998, 2002, and 2009.
   Issue: The present review summarizes data from Greenland on human
   monitoring of biomarkers of POP exposure and bioaccumulation and the
   determination of biomarkers for POP effects. The review focuses on
   hormone disruptive potentials and some genetic sensitivity biomarkers.
   The overview covers Greenlandic studies from 2000 to 2006.
   Lessons learned: The Greenland biomonitoring studies showed general
   geographical and gender differences of bioaccumulated serum POP levels,
   which were primarily related to diet and lifestyle. A high intake of
   traditional Greenlandic diet (eg seal, whale, polar bear, and seabirds)
   together with smoking caused higher blood concentrations of POPs. The
   highest POP values were found on the east coast of Greenland. The
   receptor effect studies showed a general inverse relationship between
   high serum POP concentration and estrogen receptor (ER) and Ah-receptor
   (AhR) transactivity; in addition for men in the two West Greenlandic
   districts, Nuuk and Sisimiut, a trend towards increased induced AR
   activity was found. An observed trend to an opposite direction between
   the dioxin-like AhR and ER activity supports the perception of that
   dioxins exert an antiestrogen effect. In conclusion, the actual mixtures
   of serum POPs in Greenlandic Inuit have an endocrine disrupting
   potential. Comparisons between European and Greenlandic male serum POP
   levels showed significantly higher levels in Inuit; however, in the same
   study Inuit had significantly lower sperm DNA damage. Further studies
   are required to elucidate whether the serum POP related effects on
   hormone receptors and/or AhR are explanatory factors. `The Arctic
   dilemma' is that along with the intake of the Greenlandic traditional
   diet that contains POPs, there are also a number of important nutrients,
   such as trace elements/antioxidants and marine unsaturated fatty acids
   which have favorable effects on health. However, a number of studies
   suggest that an increase in Western food items in the diet can lead to
   other health risks, such as the metabolic syndrome and its sequels
   increase in weight, hypertension, diabetes type 2, cardiovascular
   disease, and cancer, including breast cancer. To elucidate these aspects
   further studies are required, including those into biomarkers for
   exposure and effects, epigenetic contexts and the determination of
   relevant genetic polymorphisms, case-control as well as generation
   studies. Finally, there is a need for the development of new biomarkers
   to study the potential POP effects that inhibit the immune system and
   affect the development of the central nervous system.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal and organochlorine (OC) concentrations, including
   organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs),
   were determined in arctic ground squirrels; (Spermophilus, parryi!) from
   three sites in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska in 1991-93. Heavy
   metals were present in most squirrel livers collected, with
   concentrations of trace elements (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, and Pb) averaging
   below 1 mu g/g wet weight. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'-DDE, gamma
   hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), trans-nonachlor, and PCBs 138, 153,
   and 170 were the most frequently detected OCs in fat and liver. Average
   concentrations of individual OC analytes were below 20 ng/g wet weight
   in liver and below 15 ng/g wet weight in fat. Rank correlations indicate
   that concentrations of heavy metals and of OCs accumulate in concert
   with one another (As, Cd, Cu, and Zn; PCBs 138, 170, and 180). Although
   heavy metal and OC concentrations are low relative to other areas and
   other arctic species, the occurrence of these compounds illustrates the
   global pervasiveness of persistent organic compounds and the potential
   for bioaccumulation in the terrestrial arctic food web.},

Abstract = {We investigated testosterone production and semen parameters in farmed
   Arctic foxes by dietary exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
   for 22 months. Eight male foxes were given a diet of POP-contaminated
   minke whale blubber, whereas their eight male siblings were fed a
   control diet containing pig fat as the main fat source. The minke whale
   based feed contained a Sigma POPs concentration of 802 ng/g ww, whereas
   the pig based feed contained Sigma POPs of 24 ng/g ww. At the end of the
   experiment, Sigma POP concentrations in adipose tissue were 8856 +/-
   2535 ng/g ww in the exposed foxes and 1264 539 ng/g ww in the control
   foxes. The exposed group had 45-64\% significantly lower testosterone
   concentrations during their peak mating season compared to the controls
   (p <= 0.05), while the number of dead and defect sperm cells was 27\% (p
   = 0.07) and 15\% (p = 0.33) higher in the exposed group. Similar effects
   during the mating season in wild Arctic foxes may affect mating behavior
   and reproductive success. On the basis of these results, we recommend
   testosterone as a sensitive biomarker of POP exposure and that seasonal
   patterns are investigated when interpreting putative endocrine
   disruption in Arctic wildlife with potential population-level effects.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {218-224},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Captive pandas are exposed to higher concentrations of environmental
   toxins in their food source and from atmospheric pollution than wild
   pandas. Moreover, the Qinling panda subspecies had significantly higher
   concentrations of toxic chemicals in its feces. To determine whether
   these toxicants also accumulate in panda's blood and impair its health,
   concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals
   were measured in blood samples. Four heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr and Pb),
   PCDD/Fs and PCBs were detected in blood drawn from captive Qinling
   pandas. Time spent in captivity was a better predictor of toxicant
   concentration accumulation than was panda age. More than 50\% of the
   studied pandas were outside the normal levels for 11 health parameters,
   and five (ALT, LDH, Ca, Cl, TB) of the 11 parameters classified as
   abnormal were correlated with blood pollutant concentrations. The
   proportion of live sperm was significantly lower and the aberrance ratio
   of sperm was significantly greater for captive pandas than for wild
   ones. A short-term solution to reduce the health impacts of pollution
   and toxicant exposure of Qinling pandas is to relocate breeding centers

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of acute exposure to PCB99
   (2,2,4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), and PCB153
   (2,2',4,4'5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl), on spermatogenesis in 8-week-old
   C57BL6 mice. The mice were randomly allocated to PCB99 and PCB153 and a
   single dose of respectively 10 and 100mg/kg was given by oral gavage.
   During the 6-week experiment, six mice per treatment group were
   sacrificed weekly, body weights were recorded and samples with respect
   to the male reproductive system were collected until further analysis.
   None of the treatments, showed changes in body weight or reproductive
   endpoints. Flow cytometric analysis revealed spermatogenesis to be
   unaffected. However, PCB99 and PCB153 showed a significant increase in
   Leydig cell apoptosis. The results from the present study indicate that
   the male reproductive system is relatively refractory to PCB99 and
   PCB153 at levels exceeding those of wildlife and humans, when exposed
   during adult life. However, the finding of apoptotic Leydig cells merits
   further investigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Protracted Reproductive Seasonality in the Male Giant Panda

   Profiles, Ejaculate Characteristics, and Selected Behaviors},
Journal = {BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The female giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) experiences a brief
   (24-72 h) seasonal estrus, occurring once annually in spring
   (February-May). Our aim was to determine the existence and temporal
   profile of reproductive seasonality in the male of this species. The
   study was facilitated by 3 yr of access to eight giant panda males
   living in a large breeding center in China. Seasonal periods for the
   male were defined on the basis of female reproductive activity as
   prebreeding, breeding (early, peak, late), and nonbreeding seasons.
   Testes size, fecal androgen excretion, ejaculated sperm density, and
   frequency of reproductive behaviors (i.e., locomotion, scent marking,
   vocalizations) increased (P < 0.05) from the prebreeding period (October
   1-January 31) to the early breeding season (February 1-March 21). Testes
   volume and sperm concentration were maximal from March 22 through April
   15, a period coinciding with maximal female breeding activity. The
   occurrence of male reproductive behaviors and fecal androgen
   concentrations began declining during peak breeding and continued from
   April 16 through May 31 (late breeding period), returning to nadir
   throughout the nonbreeding interval (June 1-September 30). Reproductive
   quiescence throughout the latter period was associated with basal testes
   size/volume and aspermic ejaculates. Our results reveal that testes
   morphometry, fecal androgen excretion, seminal quality, and certain
   behaviors integrated together clearly demonstrate reproductive
   seasonality in the male giant panda. The coordinated increases in testes
   size, androgen production, sperm density, and sexual behaviors occur
   over a protracted interval, likely to prepare for and then accommodate a
   brief, unpredictable female estrus.},

Abstract = {Male reproductive maladaptive responses are becoming a global health
   concern and also a social issue. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a
   member of halogenated aromatic environmental pollutants with diverse
   environmental matrices. This study was conducted to explore the
   mechanisms of PCBs-induced testicular maladaptive responses and the
   potential reversal effects of d-ribose- l-cysteine (DRLC) on testicular
   injury induced by administration of PCBs (2 mg/kg) for 30 days. DRLC (50
   mg/kg) was administered orally for 15 days starting from Days 16 to 30
   after the initial 15 days of treatment with PCB. All assays were carried
   out using established protocols. Administration of DRLC at 50 mg/kg
   after treatment with PCBs enhances body and testicular weights,
   gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone),
   testosterone and poor sperm quality. DRLC also reduced testicular injury
   score, improved spermatogenesis scoring, reduced oxidative stress
   biomarkers (malondialdehyde), as well as restored the reduced activities
   of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase,
   and catalase) and decreases pro-inflammatory response (tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha and NO). More so, DRLC treatment abrogates testicular DNA
   fragmentation and downregulated p53 and caspase 3 activities and
   upregulated the concentration of autophagy-related protein (mammalian
   target of rapamycin {[}mTOR] and Atg7). DRLC abates testicular deficit
   induced by PCBs intoxicated rats via activation of the mTOR signaling
   pathway mediating inhibition of apoptosis, Inflammation and oxidative

Abstract = {Until 2011, walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) population inhabiting
   the Pechora Sea remained among the less-studied parts of the Atlantic
   subspecies. Composition and level of anthropogenic pollutants in these
   walruses have never been studied before the present work. We collected
   samples of skin and subcutaneous tissues from 15 adult males in the
   Pechora Sea and from 1 adult female from adjacent White Sea during the
   years 2011-2017. These samples were analyzed for polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and
   organochlorine pesticides. The highest concentrations were found for
   PCBs (Sigma PCB: (x) over bar +/- SE = 5700 +/- 3090 ng g(-1) lipid;
   range 40-50,400 ng g(-1) lipid, n = 16), followed by pesticides
   oxychlordane ((x) over bar +/- SE = 1090 +/- 412 ng g(-1) lipid; range
   31-5070 ng g(-1) lipid, n = 16), and 4,4'-DDE ((x) over bar +/- SE = 460
   +/- 300 ng g(-1) lipid; range 2.5-4920 ng g(-1) lipid, n = 16). PBDEs
   showed the lowest concentrations (Sigma PBDE: (x) over bar +/- SE = 13
   +/- 6.5 ng g(-1) lipid; range 0.7-104 ng g(-1) lipid, n = 16). Compared
   with walruses from Svalbard, the studied animals have considerably lower
   levels of oxychlordane, comparable levels of PBDEs, and exceeding burden
   of PCBs. Concentrations found in walruses are closer to polar bears than
   to other pinnipeds from this region (ringed and harp seals). Although
   all walruses in the sample group were mature males with exception of one
   mature female from the same location, concentrations of pollutants
   varied in very broad range. Three groups of walruses were distinguished
   by concentrations of analyzed persistent organic pollutants (POPs): low
   POP concentrations; high POP concentrations; intermediate POP
   concentrations.},

Abstract = {Several studies indicate that in utero and perinatal exposure to
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induces adverse reproductive effects,
   but it remains unclear whether such effects may be transmitted to
   subsequent generations. We therefore investigated the association
   between maternal exposure to PCBs and reproductive health in male and
   female offspring over three generations. Mouse dams were fed 0, 1, 10,
   and 100 mu g/kg/day of a PCB mixture (101 + 118) during pregnancy and
   lactation. PCB levels were measured in the tissues of both dams and
   offspring. PCB concentrations at all doses investigated were greater in
   the offspring than in the dams (p < 0.0001) confirming that the progeny
   were exposed as a result of maternal exposure. In F1 offspring, exposure
   to PCBs resulted in reductions in (1) testis weight (p < 0.05) and
   seminiferous tubule diameter (p < 0.05), (2) sperm viability (p <
   0.0001) and developmental capacity (p < 0.05), (3) ovary weight (p <
   0.05), (4) oocyte developmental capacity (p < 0.05), and (5) increased
   follicular atresia (p < 0.0001). In females, adverse effects were
   observed only in the F1 animals. In contrast, male offspring exhibited
   reduced sperm viability and altered seminiferous tubule distribution up
   to the third generation, showing intergenerational transmission. In
   summary, our data indicate that exposure to PCBs at the time of gonadal
   sex determination perturbed, significantly, the reproductive physiology
   of male and female offspring in adulthood. Furthermore, male
   reproductive deficiencies may be observed in at least two further
   generations. These findings have significant implications for
   reproductive health and fertility of animals and humans.},

Abstract = {We investigated the effects of maternal exposure to the plasticizer
   di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and the organic industrial compounds
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), singly and combined, on the
   reproductive function of male mouse offspring.
   Mice dams were exposed throughout pregnancy and lactation to 1 mu g PCBs
   (101 +118)/kg/day, 50 mu g DEHP/kg/day, or the DEHP/PCB mixture in the
   diet. The mixture induced permanent alterations in adult F1 males'
   reproductive health in a way, differently from the single compounds.
   Depending on the endpoint, we observed: (1) synergy in altering the
   gross and histological morphology of the testis; (2) antagonism on the
   expression levels of genes involved in pituitary-gonadal cross-talk; (3)
   non-interactions on sperm parameters and testosterone production.
   This study illustrates the complex action of a DEHP/PCB mixture, leading
   to a unique panel of effects on the male reproductive system, indicating
   the need for research on the reproductive hazards of combined endocrine
   disruptors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of long-term maternal exposure to low doses of PCB126 and PCB153

Journal = {REPRODUCTION},

Volume = {130},

Abstract = {In this study, female goats were orally exposed to PCB126 or PCB153, at
   49 ng/kg body weight per day and 98 mu g/kg body weight per day
   respectively, from gestational day 60 until delivery at approximately
   day 150. Exposure of the offspring continued via lactation until
   postnatal day 40. Reproductive toxicity in the male offspring was
   studied by the evaluation of conventional reproductive endpoints as well
   as flow cytometric analyses of spermatogenesis and sperm chromatin
   structure. PCB153-treated animals showed a significant smaller testis
   diameter in comparison to the control group. Neither of the treated
   groups showed differences for plasma FSH in comparison to controls.
   PCB153-treated animals differed significantly from the control group
   with respect to plasma LH and testosterone levels, whereas
   PCB126-treated animals only differed from the controls in plasma
   testosterone concentrations. Neither the PCB126 nor the PCB153 group
   differed from the controls with respect to the conventional sperm
   parameters or testis histology. A significant lower ratio of
   interstitium area to seminiferous tubules area and proportion of diploid
   testis cells were observed for the PCB153 group. Sperm from
   PCB153-treated animals showed a significantly higher percentage of sperm
   with damaged DNA. From the results of the present study it was concluded
   that PCB153 was able to induce alterations in reproductive endpoints
   related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis as well as to the testis. The
   effects observed in male kids after a long-term maternal exposure to
   PCB153 support the concept that exposure to endocrine-disrupting
   compounds during foetal development may lead to adverse reproductive
   effects in adult life.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {Contemporary climate change has complex effects on animal populations
   caused by the (non-linear) combination of multiple direct and indirect
   effects on individuals. These interactions make predictions of the
   ecological response to climate change challenging; however, predictive
   models are required to effectively manage wildlife populations and
   conserve biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate how agent-based models
   (ABMs) can be used to predict population responses under multiple
   effects of climate change. We consider the case of northern common
   eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis), a culturally and ecologically
   important seaduck which is experiencing dramatic environmental change
   due to losses in Arctic sea ice. Our model shows that losses in Arctic
   sea ice will lead to increases in nest predation by polar bears in areas
   where these species are sympatric. However, climate mediated increases
   in breeding propensity and clutch size could have a large positive
   effect on eider population size. When considered together, these effects
   are predicted to result in a relatively stable eider population size
   over a 50-year period. Additionally, assuming eider populations are
   influenced by climate change in the manner proposed in this study, our
   model suggests that future eider populations will not be more
   susceptible to extrinsic perturbations (e.g. severe weather events,
   disease outbreaks) than were historical populations. As a result, our
   study demonstrates increasing climatic suitability and increasing nest
   predation will not lead to major changes in population size in northern
   common eiders, and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple,
   interacting effects on wildlife populations experiencing climate change.},

Abstract = {Research on sociality in temperate ground-dwelling squirrels has focused
   on female philopatry and other life history trade-offs, which are
   influenced by constraints in the duration of the active growing season.
   Temperate ground-dwelling squirrels that experience high predation
   pressure, are large in body size, and have a short active season, show a
   more complex social organization. In contrast, African ground squirrels
   are active year-round, suggesting that instead of a short active season,
   distinct selective pressures influence their social organization. We
   examined the social organization of Barbary ground squirrels,
   Atlantoxerus getulus, and compared the social organization of temperate
   and African ground-dwelling sciurids. Anecdotal accounts on Barbary
   ground squirrels' social organization suggested that they were either
   solitary or gregarious, or live in small family groups. We recorded the
   group size, composition. cohesion, and genetic relatedness, of the
   population on the arid island of Fuerteventura, Spain. Our data indicate
   that females live in small (1-8) all-female kin groups separate from
   adult males, and that unrelated adult males share sleeping burrows with
   immature individuals of either sex. We observed sex-biased dispersal
   with males primarily the dispersing sex and females primarily
   philopatric. Females sleep solitarily during gestation and lactation and
   nest either communally or singly after juvenile emergence. During the
   day, males and females can be active in the same area. Barbary ground
   squirrels are social because the squirrels share sleeping burrows and
   show spatiotemporal overlap. Barbary ground squirrels' social
   organization resembles that of the closely related Cape ground squirrel
   rather than that of the temperate ground-dwelling sciurids, although the
   former are more temperate, seasonal breeders. In addition to describing
   the social organization of a previously unstudied species, this paper
   sheds light on the ecological drivers of sociality, and the evolution of
   distinct social organizations in ground-dwelling sciurids.},
