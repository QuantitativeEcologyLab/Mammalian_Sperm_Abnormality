Abstract = {Little is known of patterns of male reproductive effort and investment,
   and their relationship with age-related differences in male mating
   strategy, in mammals. In this study, the age-specific patterns of
   reproductive expenditure in a male marsupial, the common brushtail
   possum Trichosurus vulpecula were investigated. Possums were studied for
   two breeding seasons on Magnetic Island, north Queensland, Australia.
   Energy expenditure in male possums during the mating season was
   estimated from changes in mass taken monthly during live-trapping. Male
   possums lost an average of 4.2\% of their mass during the main mating
   season from January to May, suggesting that mating and consort behaviour
   is energetically expensive and may constrain foraging activity. The
   percentage of body mass lost by individual males during the breeding
   season was negatively related to age; older males directed less somatic
   investment into reproduction than young males. Older males seemed to
   target their energy expenditure toward the period when oestrus synchrony
   was highest. The pattern of age-specific energy expenditure for
   reproduction in T vulpecula differs markedly from that reported
   previously for male cervids, probably owing to the spatial dispersal of
   females leading to differences in mating strategy. The results are
   discussed in terms of their relevance to potential age-related
   differences in reproductive strategy and behaviour.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the effects of slow-release implants
   containing the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist deslorelin
   on reproduction in the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula).
   Captive female brushtail possums were assigned to control (placebo
   implant), low dose (4.7 mg deslorelin) or high dose (9.4 mg deslorelin)
   groups; males were assigned to control or high dose (9.4 mg deslorelin)
   groups. The acute effects of deslorelin treatment at the level of the
   pituitary gland were similar between the two sexes, where a transient
   rise in luteinising hormone concentration was induced over the first 24
   h. In females, this was associated with the disruption of the normal
   oestrous cycle and mating within 2-10 days in some treated individuals,
   but no young were subsequently detected. By 3 weeks after treatment,
   treated females became anoestrus and remained infertile for at least one
   breeding season. The effects of treatment were reversible in a subset of
   females that had their implants removed, although the time taken to
   produce offspring was variable. Paradoxically, male brushtail possums
   remained fertile during chronic deslorelin exposure. Despite significant
   declines in basal follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone
   concentrations, as well as an inability to respond to a GnRH challenge,
   treated males sired as many offspring as control males and there was no
   evidence of testicular regression. In conclusion, there is potential to
   control reproduction in female brushtail possums by using chronic GnRH
   agonist treatment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {1. Maternal control of offspring sex remains a contentious topic in the
   evolutionary and behavioural ecology of vertebrates. Two models of
   adaptive sex allocation - the Trivers-Willard (TW) and local resource
   competition (LRC) hypotheses - have been supported in some studies, but
   in many other cases the forces shaping offspring sex ratios are unclear.
   One reason that past studies may not have provided clear support for
   either model is that the two processes interact, producing complex
   patterns of sex allocation in relation to the life histories of
   individual mothers.
   2. The TW hypothesis predicts that in dimorphic, polygynous mammals,
   females in good condition should be more likely to produce male
   offspring. The LRC hypothesis predicts an independent effect of age on
   the offspring sex ratio; females should be more likely to produce sons
   early in their reproductive lives and daughters later, in order to
   minimize the duration and reproductive cost of mother-daughter
   competition. We tested these two predictions in a study of sex
   allocation in the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula.
   3. Offspring sex was strongly dependent on maternal age: females
   breeding for the first time were likely to produce sons, and at
   subsequent breeding attempts the sex ratio of offspring was slightly
   biased towards females. After the first breeding season, sex of
   offspring was influenced more strongly by body condition than by age,
   and females in good condition were more likely to have sons. Individual
   females that showed a between-year gain in condition were also more
   likely to produce a male in the subsequent year.
   4. Body mass of male offspring at 5 months was positively correlated
   with maternal condition. No relationship was found between maternal
   condition and mass of female offspring.
   5. We conclude that patterns of change in sex allocation in relation to
   individual life histories of female common brushtail possums can be
   explained by the interaction of TW and LRC effects.},

Abstract = {Across its native range in Australia and its introduced range in New
   Zealand the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, demonstrates
   significant flexibility in reproduction from breeding once a year in
   autumn, breeding in both autumn and spring, or breeding year round.
   Understanding variation in the seasonality of breeding has relevance to
   the management of possum populations for both management as a pest and
   their conservation. The success of possums as a colonising species in
   New Zealand has been attributed in part to their flexible breeding
   behaviour. Review of available evidence suggests that photoperiod and
   food quantity/quality influence the variation in seasonality of breeding
   and their effects are modulated by interactions with factors such as
   density, body weight and, possibly, genetics and plant secondary
   compounds. Future research is suggested to tease apart the relative
   contributions of these various factors to the observed variation.},

Abstract = {The brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a major pest species in
   New Zealand. Research to develop a possum-specific method of
   immunologically-based fertility control (immunocontraception) has begun.
   This study examined the effect of immunization against sperm on the
   fertility of possums. Possums were assigned to 16 mating groups (two
   females and one male per group) before the start of the breeding season.
   One female in each group and eight males were injected subcutaneously
   with 5 x 10(7) sperm in complete Freund's adjuvant. Animals were given
   booster injections containing 5 x 10(7) sperm in incomplete Freund's
   adjuvant 4 and 12 weeks later. Control animals received adjuvants
   emulsified with phosphate buffered saline. Serum and sperm samples were
   collected monthly and the number of offspring recorded. Reproductive
   tract samples were collected from eight immunized and eight control
   possums of each sex at the end of the breeding season. Samples were
   screened for sperm antibody binding by an indirect possum sperm ELISA.
   Increased sperm antibody binding was detected in sera of 22 (15 females
   and seven males) of the 24 animals immunized against sperm. Immunization
   significantly reduced the proportion of females producing offspring
   (2/16 immunized versus 12/16 control) but had no effect on the fertility
   of males. Immunization increased sperm antibody binding activity in
   vaginal secretions of female and in prostatic tissue of male possums.
   Results indicate that there are antigens in possum sperm with
   immunocontraceptive potential for possum control. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {The effects of forest type and disturbance on specific reproductive
   traits are unknown for many forest-dwelling mammals. We assessed whether
   differences in forest type and disturbance influenced key reproductive
   traits of an arboreal marsupial, the common brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula), in Tasmania, Australia. Trapping was conducted
   in spring-summer and autumn-winter during 2007-2008 at 6 dry Eucalyptus
   forest sites (3 regenerating and 3 relatively undisturbed) in southeast
   Tasmania and 4 wet Eucalyptus forest sites (2 regenerating and 2
   relatively undisturbed) in the northeast. We aged pouch young and
   assessed the body condition of back young. We milked females captured
   during the late stage of lactation and compared the nutritional
   composition of milk among sites. Births occurred slightly earlier at the
   northern sites than at those in the south. Female body mass and
   offspring body condition and survival were similar across sites. Milk
   composition also was similar across sites, but possums in dry,
   undisturbed forest, primarily at 1 site, produced milk with
   significantly higher fat content; however, we found no evidence of a
   difference in body condition or survival of young that could be
   attributed to a difference in milk quality. Although forest type and
   disturbance influence demography and breeding frequency in the brushtail
   possum populations we studied, these population-level differences are
   not linked to variations in the reproductive traits examined here. We
   conclude that the brushtail possum is a physiologically resilient
   species, and the ability of individual females to reproduce successfully
   is relatively insensitive to forest type or habitat disturbance.},

Abstract = {Male-biased sexual dimorphism in both size and body mass is a common
   characteristic of many polygynous mammals and is often attributed to
   sexual selection favoring large males. The degree of dimorphism is
   thought to be related to the potential for some males to monopolize
   access to estrous females, which is in turn related to the distribution
   of receptive females in space and time. In the present study, we
   investigated the relationship between the temporal distribution of
   breeding females and the degree of mass dimorphism among 11 populations
   of the common brushtail possum from northern Australia. Breeding
   patterns varied from complete aseasonality in some populations to a
   seasonal concentration of births within 2 or 3 months in others. We
   predicted that in populations in which mating opportunities were
   distributed throughout the year, dominant males would be able to
   monopolize access to larger numbers of estrous females than in
   populations in which matings were more seasonal, and in such
   populations, large body size in males would be favored. We found that
   dimorphism was related to seasonality of breeding, being greatest in
   populations with a more aseasonal pattern. Mean body mass of male
   possums also decreased with increasing population density. Population
   density may influence the degree of breeding synchrony within
   populations, particularly in locations with a more seasonal climate. The
   present study is the first to demonstrate plasticity in mass dimorphism
   in response to local variation in the synchrony of breeding in a mammal
   species.},

   significant overall difference between the two groups in a multivariate
   permutation test analagous to a t-test. Paternity analysis of 22 sibling
   pairs (resulting from experimental removal of pouch young early in the
   breeding season, inducing a second oestrous) suggested that sequential
   mating of females with the same male was uncommon (approximate to
   16-27\%). Whilst there was a tendency for female possums to mate with
   nearby males, consistent with previous observations of territorial
   mating behaviour in Australian populations, some interhabitat matings
   were also inferred. The study population displayed only a low degree of
   polygyny, which may in part reflect population and habitat
   characteristics of the study site. A comprehensive understanding of the
   mating system of Trichosurus vulpecula awaits genetic paternity analysis
   in additional populations from both Australia and New Zealand, using
   quantitative approaches undertaken in this study.},

Abstract = {This study records baseline data on the reproductive capacity of female
   brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) at Rangiora (near
   Christ-church) and compares the breeding season of captive and
   free-living possums. Repeat breeding was stimulated in captive females
   by removal of pouch young soon after birth. Captive females that bred,
   produced pouch young from March to October (more or less continuously),
   and some females produced four pouch young in one season. Free-living
   possums around Rangiora had two distinct periods of birth, in autumn
   (April/May/June) and spring (October/November). Reproduction ceased
   earlier in the year in captive possums than in possums in the wild,
   perhaps because of the stress of captivity. The probability of a given
   possum producing pouch young, and the number of pouch young produced,
   was not influenced by year, pelage colour, or the number of males in the
   breeding group. Weight was important: possums heavier than 3 kg were
   more likely to produce at least one pouch young and they produced more
   pouch young than possums <3 kg. Body weight, year, colour, and the
   number of males in the breeding group did not influence the time taken
   from introduction to the pen to birth of the first pouch young, or the
   interval between the first and second pouch young. Although fewer pouch
   young were produced in the second half of the season, the proportion of
   females giving birth to a second pouch young was not influenced by the
   month in which the first pouch young was removed. The poor productivity
   of this South Island colony compared with one in the North Island could
   be the result of the harsher climate and the southerly latitude.},

Abstract = {The brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is New Zealand's most
   important mammal pest. Options for the biological control of possums are
   being evaluated, particularly fertility control. The functions of social
   dominance hierarchies in possums have not been determined, but in many
   species dominant males breed more successfully than subordinates. This
   paper describes the effect on breeding success in captive groups of
   possums of vasectomising the dominant male. Dominance was measured by
   recording the outcome of social interactions during monthly
   observations. In groups of two male and two female brushtail possums,
   the dominant male was vasectomised (n = 7) or left untreated (n = 5).
   Five other groups with one male and two females were used as additional
   controls. In the groups where the dominant male was vasectomised, its
   dominance status remained unchanged after treatment but there were no
   further births, whereas young continued to be born in pens where males
   were untreated. At least in captivity, dominant males are therefore
   capable of behaviourally or physiologically inhibiting reproduction by
   subordinate males. This is the first evidence for such an effect in
   possums.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection should produce sexual size dimorphism in species where
   larger members of one sex obtain disproportionately more matings. Recent
   theory suggests that the degree of sexual size dimorphism depends on
   physical and temporal constraints involving the operational sex ratio,
   the potential reproductive rate and the trade-off between current
   reproductive effort and residual reproductive value. As part of a
   large-scale experiment on dispersal, we investigated the mating system
   of common brushtail possums inhabiting old-growth Eucalyptus forest in
   Australia. Paternity was assigned to 20 of 28 pouch-young (maternity
   known) genotyped at six microsatellite loci. Male mating success was
   strongly related to body size and age; male body weight and age being
   highly correlated. Despite disproportionate mating success favouring
   larger males, sexual size dimorphism was only apparent among older
   animals. Trapping and telemetry indicated that the operational sex ratio
   was effectively 1 : 1 and the potential reproductive rate of males was
   at most four times that of females. Being larger appeared to entail
   significant survival costs because males `died-off' at the age at which
   sexual size dimorphism became apparent (8-9 years). Male and female home
   ranges were the same size and males appeared to be as sedentary as
   females. Moreover, longevity appears to be only slightly less important
   to male reproductive success than it is to females. It is suggested that
   a sedentary lifestyle and longevity are the key elements constraining
   selection for greater sexual size dimorphism in this `model'
   medium-sized Australian marsupial herbivore.},

Title = {Male-Biased Predation and Its Effect on Paternity Skew and Life History
   in a Population of Common Brushtail Possums (<i>Trichosurus
   vulpecul</i>a)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Differences in predation risk may exert strong selective pressures on
   life history strategies of populations. We investigated the potential
   for predation to shape male mating strategies in an arboreal folivore,
   the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr). We predicted
   that possums in a tropical population exposed to high natural levels of
   predation would grow faster and reproduce earlier compared to those in
   temperate populations with lower predation. We trapped a population of
   possums in eucalypt woodland in northern Australia each month to measure
   life history traits and used microsatellites to genotype all individuals
   and assign paternity to all offspring. We observed very high levels of
   male-biased predation, with almost 60\% of marked male possums being
   eaten by pythons, presumably as a result of their greater mobility due
   to mate-searching. Male reproductive success was also highly skewed,
   with younger, larger males fathering significantly more offspring. This
   result contrasts with previous studies of temperate populations
   experiencing low levels of predation, where older males were larger and
   the most reproductively successful. Our results suggest that in
   populations exposed to high levels of predation, male possums invest in
   increased growth earlier in life, in order to maximise their mating
   potential. This strategy is feasible because predation limits
   competition from older males and means that delaying reproduction
   carries a risk of failing to reproduce at all. Our results show that
   life histories are variable traits that can match regional predation
   environments in mammal species with widespread distributions.},

Abstract = {Brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) are New Zealand's most
   important vertebrate pest. Options for the biological control of possums
   are being evaluated in the hope that biocontrol might provide a
   cost-effective, long-term solution not achievable by current
   technologies. Methods which inhibit possum reproduction may, however,
   affect sex steroid levels and result in changes in behaviour. In some
   species, loss of status by dominant animals allows subordinates to breed
   more successfully. This paper describes social heirarchies in captive
   groups of possums after ovariectomy of the dominant female. Seven groups
   consisting of two females and one male were established in pens and the
   dominance status of each animal was measured by recording the outcome of
   social interactions during monthly observations. In each pen, the
   dominant individual was a female. The dominant female in each pen was
   ovariectomised, and the subordinate female was given a sham operation.
   Social relationships remained unchanged in all pens for the duration of
   the experiment (5-12 months after ovariectomy). Their stability despite
   ovariectomy may be due to maintenance by adrenal steroids, or by force
   of habit. The findings of this study are encouraging because, if they
   are confirmed by similar observations of free-living possums, biocontrol
   methods that disrupt steroid production could be considered for possum
   control.},

Abstract = {Two lineages of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were
   historically introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand, and these two
   subspecies have different phenotypic forms. Despite over 100 years of
   potential interbreeding, they appear to retain morphological
   differences, which may indicate reproductive isolation. We examined this
   using population samples from a confined landscape and scored each
   specimen for phenotype using a number of fur colour traits. This
   resulted in a bimodal trait distribution expected for segregated grey
   and black lineages. We also sought evidence for genetic partitioning
   based on spatial and temporal effects. Genetic structure and rates of
   genetic mixing were determined using seven neutral, species-specific
   nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA control region
   sequence. Genotype analyses indicated high levels of variation and mtDNA
   sequences formed two major haplogroups. Pairwise tests for population
   differentiation of these markers found no evidence of subdivision,
   indicating that these brushtail possums behave as a single randomly
   mating unit. Despite maintenance of two main colour phenotypes with
   relatively few intermediates, previous inference of assortative mating
   and anecdotes of distinct races, our data indicate that New Zealand
   brushtail possums can freely interbreed, and that in some locations they
   have formed completely mixed populations where neutral genetic markers
   are unrelated to phenotype. This has implications for effective pest
   management towards eradication.},

Abstract = {Background Mammary neoplasia in possums have been sporadically reported
   in the literature.
   Case report An adult common brushtail possum with severe dyspnoea
   warranting euthanasia was submitted for postmortem examination. Necropsy
   revealed a firm pale tan multilobulated mammary mass which contained
   pale tan tissue on section. Mammary carcinoma with metastases to the
   lungs, pleura, intercostal muscles and reproductive tract was diagnosed
   microscopically. Spontaneous neoplasms in possums are rarely reported.
   To provide a comprehensive insight into possum neoplasia, a
   retrospective evaluation of female reproductive disorders of growth in
   common brushtail possums from the Australian Registry of Wildlife Health
   (ARWH), Taronga Zoo, and University of Sydney, Veterinary Pathology
   Diagnostic Services (VPDS), was performed to identify additional cases.
   Conclusion The present report describes the first published case report
   of mammary carcinoma in a common brushtail possum. This article should
   serve as a valuable reference for the types and relative frequencies of
   female reproductive disorders of growth that occur in possum species.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the diversity of class II major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) loci in the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), an
   important marsupial pest species in New Zealand. Immunocontraceptive
   vaccines, a method of fertility control that employs the immune system
   to attack reproductive cells or proteins, are currently being researched
   as a means of population control for the possum. Variation has been
   observed in the immune response of individual possums to
   immunocontraceptives. If this variability is under genetic control, it
   could compromise vaccine efficacy through preferential selection of
   animals that fail to mount a significant immune response and remain
   fertile. The MHC is an important immune region for antigen presentation
   and as such may influence the response to immunocontraceptives. We used
   known marsupial MHC sequences to design polymerase chain reaction
   primers to screen for possum MHC loci. Alpha and beta chains from two
   class II families, DA and DB, were found in possums throughout New
   Zealand. Forty new class II MHC alleles were identified in the possum,
   and the levels of variability in the MHC of this marsupial appear to be
   comparable to those of eutherian species. Preliminary population surveys
   showed evidence of clustering/variability in the distribution of MHC
   alleles in geographically separate locations. The extensive variation
   demonstrated in possums reinforces the need for further research to
   assess the risk that such MHC variation poses for long-term
   immunocontraceptive vaccine efficacy.},

Abstract = {Reverse transcription-PCR has been used to obtain a cDNA sequence from
   the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) beta-subunit gene of the
   Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Comparisons of the
   possum FSH beta-mRNA coding region nucleotide sequence with that of six
   eutherian mammal homologues reveals a mean percent identity of 77.3\%
   and 76.8\% at the nucleotide and predicted amino acid-sequence levels
   respectively. Furthermore, the predicted amino acid sequence of the
   possum FSH beta mature protein shows evolutionary conservation of twelve
   cysteine residues and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The
   protein lacks the CAGY motif present in most reported glycoprotein
   beta-subunit sequences. The translation termination codon and consensus
   polyadenylation sequence overlap, a feature observed in other mammalian
   FSH beta genes. Northern hybridization of total RNA from adult female
   possum pituitary revealed three hybridizing transcripts of approximately
   2.8, 1.2 and 0.5 kb which may arise from utilizing alternative
   polyadenylation signals. In situ hybridization localized the FSH beta
   transcripts to a sub-population of anterior pituitary cells interpreted
   as being gonadotropes. In summary the results indicate considerable
   evolutionary conservation of the structure of the FSH beta-subunit gene
   between the marsupial and eutherian mammalian lineages.},

Abstract = {Aroha is a 5 ha island in Kerikeri Inlet, Bay of Islands, which is
   joined to the North Island mainland by a 200 m long causeway. Introduced
   Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) spread into the
   general area only in the mid 1970s, and were first trapped on Aroha
   Island in June 1979. Since then possums have regularly crossed the
   causeway, and have been systematically trapped to keep the island free,
   of them. Two hundred and sixty two possums have been trapped on Aroha
   Island to December 1990, and the annual catch has increased steadily
   since 1981. About equal numbers of males and females have been trapped.
   Most possums were caught in March-April and fewest in July-August.
   Captures on the island were clustered, particularly during the breeding
   seasons. Average body weight was 2.2 kg; 97\% were greys and 3\% blacks;
   the young of females trapped on the island had been born in all months
   except December to February. In colour, body weight, and breeding
   pattern the possums trapped on Aroha Island were similar to other possum
   populations from the northern North Island. Most of the possums invading
   Aroha Island were 1-2 years old: in contrast to findings from previous
   studies of possum dispersal, Aroha Island was invaded year-round by
   young male and female possums equally. Some older animals may also have
   been attracted to the island by fruits available in an orchard there.
   Maintenance of the possum-free state of Aroha Island will require
   continuous management.},

Abstract = {Between 1980 and 1986, introduced Australian brushtail possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) were eradicated from Kapiti Island, a 1965 ha
   nature reserve. The possum population was monitored by live- and
   kill-trapping, before and at various times during the eradication
   programme, to assess the effects of population reduction on the
   reproduction and age structure of the survivors. About 70-75\% of the
   island's possums were killed in the first three years, but the massive
   and rapid population reduction had little effect on the percentage of
   females breeding, or the timing of the main breeding season in autumn,
   although the percentage of females breeding in spring increased from 0.3
   to 5\%. There was no evidence that trapping produced local shortages of
   males and disrupted normal breeding. The age structure of the population
   changed as numbers were reduced, to contain higher proportions of young
   (0-3 years old) and old (greater-than-or-equal-to 10 years old) animals.
   The last 80 animals killed were mostly either recent recruits (26\%) or
   older possums which had survived throughout the trapping programme
   (56\%).
   The minimal effect of population reduction on reproduction may have
   reflected the short time available for habitat recovery relative to the
   period of eradication and to possum longevity. The observed changes in
   age structure suggested density-dependent changes in survival,
   particularly of juveniles.},

Abstract = {The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), introduced from
   Australia about 150 years ago, has become a major pest threatening the
   native biota of New Zealand. It is also an important disease vector,
   acting as a wildlife reservoir of infection. Conventional methods of
   control have had little effect on reducing the national population, so
   there is a quest to find more effective and humane methods. This has led
   to an upsurge in research aimed at increasing our knowledge of the
   biology of this marsupial, with an attendant increase in requirements
   for access to colony-housed animals.
   Possums kept for research purposes have often been housed in individual
   cages, and several colonies have experienced high mortality rates.
   sifter capture, possums have shown inappetence, weight loss and a
   predisposition to infection, suggesting that this species is susceptible
   to post-capture stress. For our reproductive studies, research animals
   are only useful if maintained under conditions that ensure behavioural
   and physiological processes remain normal. We have adopted an `animal
   husbandry' approach for our possum colony, where social interaction and
   the ability to exhibit instinctive behaviour patterns are considered as
   important as adequate nutrition and housing.
   In this colony, group-housed possums show no signs of post-capture
   stress, and mortality rate has been less than one per cent (of > 600
   animals housed to date). Virtually all possums gain weight over the
   first month of captivity. Procedures for monitoring, handling and the
   collection of data from these animals, are carried out with little
   apparent stress to either animals or staff.},

Abstract = {Plants contain a variety of chemical defenses that strongly affect
   feeding rates in captive mammals, but their effects on the. fitness of
   wild herbivores are largely unknown. This is because the complexity of
   defensive compounds, and herbivores' counteradaptations to them, make
   their effects in the wild difficult to measure. We show how tannins
   interact with protein to produce spatial variation in the nutritional
   quality of eucalypt foliage, which is related to demography in a wild
   population of a marsupial folivore, the common brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr). Tannins reduced the digestibility of
   nitrogen (N) in vitro, creating variation in available N concentrations
   among the home ranges of individual possums in an otherwise homogeneous
   habitat. This was strongly correlated with reproductive success: females
   with better quality trees in their home range reproduced more often and
   had faster-growing offspring. These results demonstrate a powerful
   mechanism by which spatial variation in plant chemistry may control
   herbivore population dynamics in nature.},

Abstract = {Brushtail possums are generally solitary animals. They use a range of
   olfactory, auditory, visual, and tactile behaviour to achieve spacing
   between individuals and to establish dominance hierarchies. Existing
   descriptions of possum behaviour are either not widely available or
   incomplete, and the function of dominance hierarchies is unclear. Data
   presented here were collected incidentally during observations of
   captive possums to determine the effects on dominance status of
   suppression of reproduction for biological control. Dominant and
   subordinate behaviour are described and reviewed. The top-ranking
   possums in dominance hierarchies were always females. Dominant possums
   displaced subordinates from food, water, and dens. In our captive
   setting, only dominant males attempted to mate with females, but
   dominant and subordinate females produced a similar number of pouch
   young. In the wild, where resources are limited, we predict that
   dominance behaviour should limit the frequency and success of breeding
   by both subordinate males and females.},

   Freeze-fracture studies indicate a change in organization of plasmalemma
   intramembranous particles of both the head and midpiece of the tail as
   the spermatozoa pass from the caput to cauda epididymides. Staining with
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-lectins shows that heads of caput
   spermatozoa stain with Con A, WGA, RCA(120), LCA and JAC, whereas those
   from the cauda epididymides stain only with LCA and JAC, thus suggesting
   that N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, alpha-D-glucose, or beta-D-galactose
   may either become lost or masked during epididymal transit. A reduction
   of alpha-D-mannose is also suggested. Collectively these results show
   that the plasmalemma of the spermatozoon of at least this marsupial
   species undergoes both protein and saccharide modification during
   transit of the epididymis. How these findings relate to sperm maturation
   in preparation for sperm-egg binding has yet to be determined.},

Title = {Brushtail possums (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>) in metropolitan Sydney:
   population biology and response to Suprelorin contraceptive implants},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {The cohabitation of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula)
   with people in urban areas often causes conflict. Basic biological
   parameters are needed to evaluate potential new management options such
   as fertility control. This study investigated the biology of an urban
   brushtail possum population and the effects of Suprelorin contraceptive
   implants on individual females within that population. Trapping success
   remained constant over time, with 2.8 +/- 0.2 individuals trapped per
   residential property. Recapture rates for males declined rapidly over
   time, with only 30\% of males recaptured on the same property 12 months
   after initial capture (n = 30) and no males recaptured after 18 months
   (compared with female recapture rates of 58\% after 18 months, n = 33).
   These data, combined with the preponderance of males observed within the
   lower age classes, suggests that male possum turnover is high within
   urban areas. This may be partially compensated for by the male-bias (1.8
   : 1) observed in pouch young. Breeding was seasonal with the main peak
   of births in autumn, and a secondary smaller peak in spring. Suprelorin
   contraceptive treatment effectively inhibited reproduction in adult
   females for a minimum duration of 519 +/- 7 (n = 5) and >= 700 +/- 20 (n
   = 5) days after administration of one or two 4.7-mg implants,
   respectively, with no negative side-effects obvious. The concurrent
   collection of data on contraceptive efficacy and population-specific
   life-history parameters provides a unique opportunity to highlight the
   importance of understanding local population dynamics when evaluating
   the likely efficacy and implementation of fertility control programs to
   manage problem wildlife.},

Abstract = {Frozen storage of semen and embryos is now a well established part of
   the breeding of many eutherian mammals but it has not been applied to
   marsupials.  This paper reports the first successful technique for the
   frozen preservation of marsupial spermatozoa.
   Semen was collected by electroejaculation under anaesthesia from a pool
   of five brushtail possums.  The ejaculated semen was diluted 1:1 with
   Krebs Henseleit Ringer, centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, resuspended in
   the test cryoprotectant media at 1, 2 and 5 x 10(6) spermatozoa mL-1 and
   7, 10.5, 14 and 17.5\% glycerol and then drawn up into 0.25 mL plastic
   straws.  The spermatozoa were rapidly frozen in the vapour phase, 6 cm
   above liquid nitrogen, for 30 min before the straws were plunged into
   the liquid.  Sperm motility was assessed blind for coded straws by
   phase-contrast microscopy on a warmed stage (35-degrees-C), before
   freezing and after rapid thawing in a water bath at 37-degrees-C (10 s).
   The highest recovery of both percentage motility (around 50-60\%) and
   progressive motility (around 0.5-1 unit lower than prefreeze) occurred
   when spermatozoa were frozen and thawed in the presence of 17.5\%
   glycerol.  Recovery of motility was greater at the higher sperm
   concentrations (2 and 5 x 10(6) mL-1).  There was no evidence of
   acrosomal damage or loss after freezing and thawing in high
   concentrations of glycerol.  The only defect detected in spermatozoa
   subjected to the protocol was a variable tendency to bending of the neck
   region.  This ranged from heads inclined at a slight angle to the tail
   through to complete flexure.  Head bending was found to be due not to
   freezing but to incubation of spermatozoa in high glycerol medium at RT.
   If post-thawing assessments were made at 35-degrees-C head bending was
   abolished.  The fertility of the possum sperm frozen by this method has
   yet to be established.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {136},

Abstract = {ovarian-based immunological research is currently restricted to proteins
   of the zona pellucida. This study examined the immunocontraceptive
   potential of a novel vesicle-associated protein, VAP1, previously
   isolated from the vesicle-rich hemisphere of the brushtail possum
   oocyte. Seven female possums were immunized against recombinant
   glutathione S-transferase-VAP1 fusion protein. Control animals (n=3)
   received antigen-free vaccinations. Following immunization, regular
   blood sampling determined the level and duration of immune response.
   Animals were monitored daily, pre- and post-immunization, to determine
   estrous cycling activity and the percentage of reproductive cycles
   yielding viable young. The reproductive tracts and somatic organs of
   VAP1-immunized (n=7), control-immunized (n=3) and non-immunized (n=5)
   animals were collected and examined by histology and transmission
   electron microscopy. VAP1 immunization caused a strong and sustained
   immune response. Elevated levels of VAP1 antibody binding were detected
   in sera following initial injections, and immune titers rose as boosters
   were administered. Immunization had no adverse effect upon animal
   behavior or body condition. immunized females demonstrated no major
   change in annual estrous cycling activity; however, the percentage of
   reproductive cycles resulting in pouch young decreased significantly (P
   < 0.05) by 40\%. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed an
   abundance of lipid-like degradation bodies within the ooplasm of
   developing oocytes and the cytoplasm of failing uterine zygotes. Active
   macrophage invasion of enlarged endometrial glands was observed in the
   uteri of two females. Reproductive tract changes are discussed in
   relation to observed fertility decline. The results of this study
   indicate that VAP1 has exciting potential as an immunocontraceptive
   target for possum control in New Zealand.},

Abstract = {This study investigated sperm transport following superovulation and
   artificial insemination (AI) in the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus
   vulpecula. Females were superovulated by treatment with 15 IU pregnant
   mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) then 4 mg luteinizing hormone (LH) 78 h
   later. Inseminations were performed 27 h after LH (4 million motile
   spermatozoa/ uterus). At 1.5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h after AI (n = 5 per
   group), females were euthanised and reproductive tracts removed for
   examination and flushed for sperm. No ovulations had occurred by 1.5 h,
   but 20\% of animals had ovulated by 3 or 6 h, and 80\% by 9 or 12 fi.
   The mean numbers of spermatozoa recovered ranged from 249 to 275 X 10(3)
   in the uterus; 16-51 X 10(3) in the isthmus; 8-11 X 10(3) in the middle
   segment; and 6-16 X 10(3) in the ampulla at 1.5, 3 and 6 h after Al.
   Sperm numbers in all regions decreased at later times (P < 0.05) except
   the isthmus, where 100 X 10(3) sperm were recovered by 12 h, Highly
   motile thumbtack sperm (a putative indicator of capacitation in
   marsupials), were recovered from the isthmus (20\%), middle segment
   (50\%) and ampulla (90\%) at all sampling times, but not from the
   uterus. The epithelium of the oviduct segments contained mucus-secreting
   and ciliated cells and peak secretory activity was observed in the
   ampulla at 6 h. At 3, 6 and 12 h, many spermatozoa were found in
   epithelial folds within the isthmus. The present study has provided
   basic information on sperm transport and storage events within the
   female reproductive tract of T. vulpecula following superovulation and
   AI. It is concluded that this model may be useful to better understand
   pre-fertilization sperm maturation events in the possum, which could
   facilitate the development of IVF technology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The breeding biology of Trichosurus vulpecula has been studied in some
   detail for temperate populations but not for the northern brushtail
   possum (T. v. arnhemensis), the tropical form of this species. Data for
   the distribution of births and sex ratio of the young, growth and
   development of the young and reproductive cycles of both males and
   females were obtained. Most data were collected from a captive breeding
   colony of northern brushtails and supplemented with data from wild
   populations.
   The reproduction, growth and development of T. v. arnhemensis are very
   similar to those already described for other populations of T vulpecula.
   The observed differences can be explained by variation in the size of
   the animals and the absence of a restricted breeding season. Neither
   males nor females showed any periodicity in their reproductive strategy.
   This continuous breeding cycle can be attributed directly to their
   tropical environment.
   These tropical possums occupy a stable habitat, mature early and have a
   higher reproductive effort than populations in more seasonal and
   unpredictable environments. This suggests that the northern brushtail
   has a stochastic or `bet-hedging' reproductive strategy.},

Abstract = {Information on the dynamics of gamete interaction in marsupials is very
   Limited and not available for any species from the major Australian
   Order Diprotodontia which includes most of the more familiar animals
   such as kangaroos, possums and the koala. This study addressed this
   deficiency by examining the ultrastructure of in vivo fertilised eggs
   from common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Females were
   superovulated by treatment with 15 IU PMSG and then 4 mg porcine LH 3
   days later, and inseminations were performed 910-13 h after LH) using
   epididymal spermatozoa. Between 33 and 39 h after LH injection females
   were killed, reproductive tracts excised and the oviduct ampulla segment
   flushed for eggs. Three of the six eggs examined were fertilised as
   judged by the presence of sperm remnants in the cytoplasm. On the basis
   of these eggs it was found that sperm penetration left a large hole in
   the zona pellucida (ZP), suggesting that sperm zona penetration occurs
   primarily by the enzymatic action of acrosomal enzymes. Sperm lying
   within the perivitelline space were lacking both an outer acrosomal
   membrane and the associated acrosomal contents, while both these
   structures were found on sperm embedded within the mucoid layer, which
   is consistent with induction of the acrosome reaction by binding to the
   ZP. Once inside the egg cytoplasm, the sperm head travelled only a short
   distance before chromatin decondensation occurred. Fertilised eggs
   showed signs of cytoplasmic activation including cytoskeleton
   association with apparently dividing mitochondria and prominent rough
   endoplasmic reticulum. Unfertilised eggs appeared to be undergoing
   degenerative changes and lacked any evidence of activation. This study
   has demonstrated that superovulation and laparoscopic intravaginal
   artificial insemination provide a system through which perifertilisation
   events in the possum and other monovular Australian marsupials can be
   examined experimentally.},

   investigated following oral, intranasal/conjunctival, parenteral, and
   intraduodenal administration to evaluate the BG-ZP3 system for possum
   fertility control. Antibodies to possum ZP3 were detected in the serum,
   oviduct secretions, and follicular fluid of immunised animals.
   Intranasal/conjunctival immunisation elicited reliable antibody immune
   response in serum and at a key effector site, the ovarian follicular
   fluid. Intraduodenal administration of possum ZP3 BG vaccine as a
   priming immunisation elicited significant systemic immune responses, but
   oral immunisation did not, indicating that protection of BG vaccines
   from degradation by gastric acidity would enhance the effectiveness of
   orally delivered vaccines. The detection of antibodies at elevated
   levels at target sites in the reproductive tract following mucosal
   delivery demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of BGs as an
   effective system for vaccine delivery to wild animals, and
   intranasal/conjunctival immunisation as a promising means for delivery
   of immunocontraceptive vaccines to wild animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The common brushtail possum ( Trichosurus vulpecula) is noted for its
   morphological, biological and ecological variability across its range.
   Despite having suffered substantial population declines since European
   settlement, relatively little has been published on the south- western
   Australian subspecies, the koomal ( T. v. hypoleucus). This study
   reports morphological, reproductive and general life- history data from
   an 18- month study of a population in the southern jarrah ( Eucalyptus
   marginata) forest at Chariup ( part of Perup), near Manjimup, in south-
   western Australia. As one of the smallest subspecies, adult males of T.
   v. hypoleucus averaged 1616 g and females averaged 1470 g. Sexual
   dimorphism also occurred with head length and pes length, but not tail
   length. A single autumn breeding season occurred in both 2002 and 2003,
   in which all adult females bred and produced a single young between
   February and May. The onset of autumn births was associated with the end
   of the summer drought. Unlike many other Trichosurus populations, no
   spring breeding pulse or ` double- breeding' events were observed. At
   least 83\% of pouch young survived to pouch emergence. The growth rate
   of offspring was initially linear, but became curvilinear and approached
   an asymptote after similar to 5 months. Most females bred for the first
   time when they were 1 year old. On the basis of testis size, males also
   matured at 1 year old. The body condition of adult males, but not adult
   females, changed significantly over time and followed an apparently
   seasonal pattern in which their condition was poorest in winter and best
   in summer. While many of the life- history traits of the Chariup
   population were similar to those of other south- western Australian
   populations of T. v. hypoleucus, the most striking variations included
   age at maturity, extent of spring breeding pulse and female fecundity.
   Further comparisons with conspecifics elsewhere in Australia and New
   Zealand also highlight the variability exhibited by T. vulpecula across
   its range. Some aspects of the biology of T. v. hypoleucus were
   particularly similar to those observed for T. v. arnhemensis in northern
   Australia.},

   at Castlepoint in the Wairarapa, New Zealand},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Brushtail possums at a 21 ha site at Castlepoint in the Wairarapa, New
   Zealand, were studied with capture-mark-recapture from August 1989 to
   August 1994. The mean annual adult population density, based on counts
   of mature possums trapped each year, was 8.7 per ha and varied by only
   small amounts during the study period. The median survival age was 32
   months (95\% CI 28-39) for females and 27 months (95\% CI 26-30) for
   males. Mean body weights were 2.47 kg (95\% CI 2.46-2.49) for mature
   male possums and 2.34 kg (95\% CI 2.32-2.36) for mature female possums.
   Body weights were lowest in autumn-winter, increased during spring and
   were highest during summer in each year. Breeding started in March each
   year and there was a secondary pulse in spring. No births were recorded
   in the summer. The median age for time to first successful mating for
   females was 14 months and almost all females bred each year. Rates for
   successful breeding in both autumn and spring ranged from 100\% for the
   90th percentile to 56\% for the 10th percentile. The population
   contained more males than females throughout the study period but
   depopulation data showed a predominance of males in the age group of up
   to 4 years and similar proportions thereafter. The outstanding features
   of this population were its high density, high fecundity, breeding at an
   early age and a short life expectancy. It illustrates the widely varying
   location-specific performance of the species. Known causes of death
   included tuberculosis, iatrogenic haemopericardium and
   exposure-starvation. Juvenile possums often used dens that appeared to
   give poor protection during rain and cold conditions, and our
   observations suggest that a lack of dens which could provide protection
   from adverse weather was probably more important than abundance of food
   in regulating population density in the ecological setting at
   Castlepoint.},

Abstract = {The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a pest of
   considerable economic importance in New Zealand. Attempts to develop
   methods of suppressing reproduction in this species are currently
   hampered by the lack of reliable methods to synchronise oestrus and
   ovulation in this species, The objective of this study was to compare
   antral follicle populations in anoestrous and cyclic brushtail possums
   and to assess the efficacy of exogenous FSH to induce follicle
   development in anoestrous animals. Ovaries were recovered from
   anoestrous possums after administration of either exogenous FSH (1.0
   mg/injection) or the saline vehicle alone (0.5 ml/injection) at 12-h
   intervals for 3 days (n = 6/group), and from cyclic animals (n = 6) that
   were euthanised in mid-follicular phase (5 days after removal of their
   pouch young). All antral follicles greater than or equal to 1.0 mm in
   diameter were dissected free of extraneous tissue, incubated in vitro to
   measure oestradiol production, and then processed for histological
   assessment of health status. Mean weight of ovaries and vaginal
   cul-de-sac tissues were both significantly greater (P < 0.001) in
   FSH-treated anoestrous females (24.2 +/- 5.1 mg and 6.50 +/- 1.34 g,
   respectively), bur did nor differ significantly between saline-treated
   anoestrous possums (12.4 +/- 3.0 mg and 1.31 +/- 0.27 g) and cyclic
   animals (13.5 +/- 1.6 mg and 2.62 +/- 0.95 g). Mean uterine weights in
   both cyclic (889 +/- 161 mg) and FSH-treated (1098 +/- 184 mg) animals
   were significantly heavier(P < 0.001) than those of anoestrous possums
   (414 +/- 61 mg). The mean number of follicles (greater than or equal to
   1.0-mm diameter) present was significantly greater (P< 0.001) in
   FSH-treated, than in cyclic and anoestrous possums (38.0 +/- 4.4, 23.2
   +/- 3.2 and 10.7 +/- 3.4 follicles/animal, respectively). Cyclic animals
   had significantly more (P < 0.01) follicles than anoestrous possums, The
   proportion of follicles that were classified as healthy, was
   significantly lower (P < 0.01) in cyclic possums (38\%) than in
   anoestrous (69\%) and FSH-treated (88\%) animals. The mean diameter of
   the largest healthy follicle present was 2.5 +/- 0.41, 2.1 +/- 0.08, and
   3.1 +/- 0.15 mm for cyclic, anoestrous and FSH-treated animals,
   respectively. None of the follicles harvested from saline-treated
   anoestrous possums produced measurable levels of oestradiol in vitro,
   whereas 7\% and 59\% of those from cyclic and FSH-treated animals did
   so. In summary, cyclic possums had more antral follicles present than
   anoestrous animals, but a lower percentage of these follicles were
   healthy. Less than 10\% of healthy follicles from cyclic possums, and
   none of those from anoestrous animals, were capable of producing
   oestradiol when incubated in vitro. Treatment with ovine FSH promoted
   follicle development in anoestrous possums, to significantly increase
   the number of follicles present. the proportion that were healthy and
   the percentage capable of producing oestradiol. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {The population ecology of Trichosurus vulpecula has been studied
   extensively in temperate Australia and in New Zealand. This paper
   provides the results of a trapping study of a population of the northern
   brushtail possum (T. vulpecula arnhemensis Collett 1897) in the wet-dry
   tropics of Australia's Northern Territory. Possums were readily trapped
   and the population had a comparatively high density for Australian
   brushtails of around 3 per hectare. The core home-range size and range
   length for males was 1.12 ha and 165 m; this was a little larger than
   for females (0.89 ha and 155 m). The possums were not very agressive
   when handled and were apparently quite socially tolerant. The ready
   availability of nutritious food sources throughout the year enables them
   to breed continuously, producing 1.7 young per year per adult female. If
   environmental conditions become unfavourable with a series of poor wet
   seasons or frequent fires, the habitat will resemble the less-productive
   eucalypt forest not occupied by possums. Mortality of pouch young and
   immatures will increase under these conditions but with a potential
   reproductive rate of nearly two per year, populations of the northern
   brushtail can readily recover from short periods of unfavourable
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Ovaries from young of the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, were
   examined histologically and histochemically to determine stages of
   oogenesis. Groups of dividing oogonia were first present in a 13-day-old
   pouch young, with extensive oogonial proliferation after about 23 days
   of age. Meiosis was initiated in some oogonia by 48 days of age, and by
   88 days numerous early primordial follicles were present. The first
   primary follicles had formed by 103 days of age.
   In oocytes of quiescent primordial follicles, dark granular material,
   which stained positively for protein, mainly occupied the perinuclear
   cytoplasm. Associated with the transition to primary follicles and
   continuing throughout oocyte growth was the production within the
   central cytoplasm of large clear vesicles and, to a lesser extent,
   lipid-like yolk bodies. The former were analogous to similar vesicles
   found in other species of marsupial, and have a putative role in
   development of the blastocyst. By contrast, yolk-like bodies are not
   found in all marsupial oocytes and their importance in development is
   unknown.},

Abstract = {Temporal variation in the rheometric properties of the proximal and
   distal colonic digesta of an arboreal marsupial folivore, the common
   brushtail possum, was examined to assess flow behaviour during
   peristalsis, segmentation and other aspects of intestinal motility. The
   time-dependent rheometric characteristics on application of a constant
   shear stress within the physiological range showed an initial elastic
   and subsequent viscoelastic phase, which fitted Burger's model of creep
   compliance. Similarly, the time-dependent rheometric characteristics on
   recovery from shear stress fitted with a generalised two-component
   Maxwell model of elastic and viscoelastic components for creep recovery.
   Differences in the relative magnitudes of the viscoelastic components
   during recovery from those during shear indicated that the physical
   properties of the digesta plug changed with sustained shear stress, a
   phenomenon, which is likely to result from extrusion of the liquid phase
   from the solid elements of the digesta plug. There was significant
   viscoelastic recovery during the initial 4 s following cessation of
   stress, which would allow for prompt concomitant reabsorption of the
   liquid phase into the digesta plug. This supports a hypothesis of
   alternate extrusion and reabsorption of the liquid phase of the digesta
   plug. This would promote both nutrient absorption across the intestinal
   wall (from liquid extrusion) and enzyme permeation and digestion (from
   liquid absorption into the plug). However, the presence of a slower
   component of viscoelastic recovery indicates that liquid phase
   reabsorption into the digesta plug is incomplete if the interval before
   a subsequent contraction is less than 150 s, in which case unreabsorbed
   liquid may be driven either orally or aborally. This would at least
   partly account for differences in retention times of liquid and solid
   phase digesta markers reported for the gastrointestinal tracts of
   numerous vertebrate species.},

Abstract = {We investigated the passive mechanical properties of villi in ex vivo
   preparations of sections of the wall of the distal ileum from the
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) by using a flow cell to impose
   physiological and supra-physiological levels of shear stress on the tips
   of villi. We directly determined the stress applied from the magnitude
   of the local velocities in the stress inducing flow and additionally
   mapped the patterns of flow around isolated villi by tracking the
   trajectories of introduced 3 mu m microbeads with bright field micro
   particle image velocimetry (mPIV). Ileal villi were relatively rigid
   along their entire length (mean 550 mu m), and exhibited no noticeable
   bending even at flow rates that exceeded calculated normal physiological
   shear stress (>0.5 mPa). However, movement of villus tips indicated that
   the whole rigid structure of a villus could pivot about the base, likely
   from laxity at the point of union of the villous shaft with the
   underlying mucosa. Flow moved upward toward the tip on the upper
   portions of isolated villi on the surface facing the flow and downward
   toward the base on the downstream surface. The fluid in sites at
   distances greater than 150 mu m below the villous tips was virtually
   stagnant indicating that significant convective mixing in the lower
   intervillous spaces was unlikely. Together the findings indicate that
   mixing and absorption is likely to be confined to the tips of villi
   under conditions where the villi and intestinal wall are immobile and is
   unlikely to be greatly augmented by passive bending of the shafts of
   villi.},

Abstract = {The Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a nocturnal,
   arboreal Marsupial. It has become a pest of significant ecological and
   economic importance in New Zealand, and thus a renewed interest ill
   understanding the reproductive biology of this species has been
   generated. The corpus luteum (CL) in possums is a largely autonomous
   gland in that it does not rely oil pituitary hormones to function and is
   not responsive to luteolytic agents for its demise. Its importance in
   regulating the oestrous cycle and pregnancy has been established;
   however, little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in its
   function. Interstitial tissue (IT) is a prominent feature found
   throughout the ovarian stroma, yet little is known regarding the origin
   or function of these cells. Based on histological examinations, Our data
   support the hypothesis that interstitial tissue arises from a unique
   cell type called medullary cords during early ovarian development. Using
   possum-specific probes for proteins involved in steroidogenesis,
   receptors for pituitary hormones and members of the TGF-beta superfamily
   we have initiated studies investigating the expression of genes that may
   be important in the function and regulation of the CL and interstitial
   tissue. Results show that both tissues are steroidogenic and that both
   express receptors for prolactin and luteinising hormone (LH).
   Collectively these findings suggest that prolactin and LH may be
   important in the regulation of steroidogenesis in the CL and
   interstitial tissue ill Possums. (C) 2002 Flsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {The ovary of the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) secretes
   steroids; however, little is known about the identity of the
   steroidogenic cells in the ovary. The aim of the present study was to
   determine the identity of the ovarian cell types expressing mRNAs
   encoding proteins important for steroidogenesis and determine at what
   stage of follicular development they are expressed. The genes examined
   were those for steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), steroidogenic acute
   regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage
   (P450(scc)), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta(5),Delta(4)
   isomerase (3betaHSD), cytochrome P45017alphahydroxylase (P45017alphaOH),
   and P450 aromatase (P450(arom)). None of the genes examined were
   expressed in oocytes at any stage of follicular development. SF-1 was
   expressed in granulosa cells from the type 2 or the primary stage of
   development and thereafter to the preovulatory stage. In addition, the
   theca interna of small and medium-size antral but not pre-ovulatory
   follicles and the interstitial glands and corpora lutea expressed SF-1
   mRNA. Granulosa cells of preantral and small to medium-size antral
   follicles were not capable of synthesizing steroids from cholesterol
   because they did not contain P450(scc) mRNA. However, granulosa cells of
   many of the small to medium-size antral follicles expressed P450(arom)
   and 3betaHSD mRNA. The interstitial glands, theca interna, and corpus
   luteum expressed StAR, P450(scc), 3betaHSD, and P45017alphaOH mRNA,
   suggesting that these tissues are capable of synthesizing progestins and
   androgens. The corpus luteum expressed P450(arom), indicating that this
   tissue also has the potential to secrete estrogens in this species.},

Abstract = {Variation in localization and distribution of saccharides on the sperm
   surface of a marsupial, the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, was
   compared between spermatozoa from the caput and cauda epididymides.
   Spermatozoa were subjected to the following treatments: (i) unfixed and
   fixed spermatozoa were stained with fluorescein-labelled lectins; (ii)
   unfixed spermatozoa were incubated with lectins for determination of
   agglutination; and (iii) spermatozoa were incubated with detergent to
   remove the plasmalemma, the glycoproteins were separated on SDS-PACE and
   western blots were stained with biotinylated lectins. Many of the
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled lectins bound selectively to
   the sperm surface, and marked differences were found in lectin staining
   affinity between caput and cauda epididymal spermatozoa. Incubation of
   spermatozoa from the cauda epididymidis with neuraminidase reversed many
   of the differences in staining of the cauda epididymal spermatozoa,
   indicating masking of some terminal saccharides by sialic acid.
   Agglutination of spermatozoa from the caput epididymidis occurred after
   incubation with Concanavalin A (ConA) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), but
   agglutination was less extensive for spermatozoa from the cauda
   epididymidis. Western blot analysis indicated several ConA-positive
   bands in caput sperm extracts, but fewer positive bands in the cauda
   sperm extracts, whereas SEA stained four bands from caput but none from
   the cauda epididymal spermatozoa. These results demonstrate extensive
   glycosylation of the surface proteins of spermatozoa from the caput
   epididymidis and significant differences in spermatozoa from the cauda
   epididymidis. In general, the findings indicate similar glycosylation of
   the surface of marsupial spermatozoa to those from eutherian mammals
   despite marked differences in their morphology and early divergence of
   marsupials from eutherian mammals. It would appear that this situation
   differs markedly from that in sub-mammalian vertebrates.},

Abstract = {We investigated the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium in a marsupial,
   namely the brushtail possum ( Trichosurus vulpecula), using semithin
   sections of seminiferous tubules embedded in Spurr's resin. Using 14
   steps of spermatid development as markers, we were able to class tubular
   cross-sections into 10 well-defined stages of the seminiferous
   epithelial cycle. The duration of one cycle was 13.5 days, as determined
   by injections of {[}H-3]-thymidine and autoradiographic examination of
   the most advanced sperm cells at 2 h and 17 days after injection. The
   durations of stages I - X were 21.4, 66.4, 54.1, 47.0, 29.8, 28.5, 25.3,
   25.0, 12.0 and 15.9 h, respectively, estimated by the relative
   percentage of occurrence of each stage. It was estimated that the life
   spans of the main germ cells were as follows: type B spermatogonia, 5.4
   days; primary spermatocytes, 16.7 days; secondary spermatocytes, 0.7
   days; and spermatids, 21.4 days. The results suggest that the kinetics
   of spermatogenesis in marsupials show a similar pattern to that in
   eutherians.},

Abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used to study the intake and
   digestion of tannin-rich plants by mammalian herbivores because it
   preferentially binds to tannins. However, it is not clear whether the
   responses of herbivores to dietary PEG is due to increased protein
   availability from the release of tannin-bound protein, amelioration of
   tannin effects, or whether PEG also may bind to other compounds and
   change their activity in the gut. We used three native New Zealand tree
   species to measure the effect of PEG on the amount of foliage eaten by
   invasive common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and on in
   vitro digestible nitrogen (available N). The addition of PEG increased
   the in vitro available N content of Weinmannia racemosa foliage, and
   possums ate significantly more PEG-treated foliage than untreated
   foliage. However, possums also ate more PEG-treated Fuchsia excorticata
   foliage, even though PEG did not increase in vitro available N in this
   species. Possums ate very little Melicytus ramiflorus, regardless of PEG
   treatment, even though M. ramiflorus contained the highest concentration
   of in vitro available N. These results prompted us to use PEG and a
   protein supplement, casein, to manipulate the available N concentration
   of diets containing ground eucalypt foliage, a well-studied food species
   for possums. Again, the response of possums to PEG was independent of
   changes in in vitro available N. In addition, altering the protein
   content of the diet via the addition of casein did not affect how much
   food the possums consumed. We conclude that the effects of PEG on dry
   matter intake by mammalian herbivores are not due solely to the release
   of tannin-bound protein. There is need for a better understanding of
   PEG-tannin interactions in order to ensure that the use of PEG in
   nutritional studies does not outstrip an understanding of its mechanisms
   of action.},

Abstract = {The main role of kappa -casein in milk is to stabilize the formation of
   casein micelles. Although marsupial milk contains casein micelles, kappa
   -casein had not been identified in any species. In these experiments,
   the first marsupial kappa -casein has been prepared as enriched casein
   fractions and the cDNA cloned from the brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula). Possum kappa -casein is a 158 amino acid peptide that shares
   low amino acid sequence identity (20-30\%) with that of eutherian kappa
   -caseins. In the gut of suckling young, casein micelles clot when kappa
   -casein is cleaved by chymosin at a specific site. Eutherian kappa
   -casein sequences are classified according to the sequence of the
   chymosin cleavage site: Phe-Met, Phe-Ile or Phe-Leu. Possum kappa
   -casein appears to form a separate class, with a putative chymosin
   cleavage site of Phe-Ala, which is different from that found in
   eutherian mammals. Other features of kappa -caseins, such as the
   location of the N-terminal cysteine, solubility in the presence of
   calcium, and the O-glycosylation sites on threonine residues in the
   C-terminus of the molecule, are conserved in the possum sequence. The
   kappa -casein gene was expressed throughout lactation in the mammary
   gland, and although mRNA levels of kappa-, alpha- and beta -casein
   varied between animals there appeared to be a correlation in the
   expression of these genes within an individual animal. This suggests
   that a common transcription regulatory region may be controlling
   expression of all three genes in the possum.},

Abstract = {Reproductive data were collected from captive brushtail possums,
   Trichosurus vulpecula, by examining daily urine samples for the presence
   of non-keratinised and keratinised epithelial cells, polymorphonuclear
   leucocytes, and sperm. Around the time of oestrus there was a massive
   increase in the number of epithelial cells and leucocytes in urine. The
   pattern of cell shedding was similar in mated and non-mated females
   undergoing either spontaneous ovulations or those induced by removal of
   pouch young. There was no difference between fertile or non-fertile
   oestrous cycles. During the 2-month sampling period, 97\% of females
   showed changes in cell numbers indicative of oestrus and 72\% of females
   were confirmed to have been mated by the presence of sperm. Conception
   rate was 74\% and offspring were horn 16-19 days after mating. When
   pouch young were removed, 85\% of females were mated 7-15 days later and
   77\% of mated females produced pouch young. Compared with vaginal
   smears, collection and examination of urine was easier and faster, only
   one animal handler was required, the method was less stressful for the
   possum, and cell types in the sample were scored directly without the
   need for fixation and staining.},

Abstract = {Wild brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) occur in large numbers in
   the grounds of Perth Zoo, Western Australia. These possums are a problem
   because they consume feed the zoo buys for its captive animals, damage
   seedlings and trees and many need to be treated for injuries sustained
   during fights with conspecifics. A contraceptive implant, which contains
   the gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist deslorelin, could be
   a potential method of managing this population. We tested the efficacy
   of the implant and its impact on the body-condition index of treated
   possums with Kaplan-Meier analysis and a mixed model with residual
   maximum likelihood. We implanted 60 female possums with deslorelin and
   monitored reproductive success of treated and untreated possums for the
   following 18 months. At the conclusion of the study, 80\% of 20 treated
   females recaptured had shown no evidence of breeding activity, giving an
   average minimum duration of effective contraception of 381 days. The
   implant did not have a negative impact on the body-condition index of
   treated possums during the course of the study. Our results suggest that
   deslorelin implants could be an effective management tool for brushtail
   possums at Perth Zoo and in other urban environments.},

Abstract = {Live-captured feral brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) received
   slow-release progestagen implants for 16 days after removal of pouch
   young. At the time of implant removal one group was injected
   intramuscularly with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG, 2 I.U.
   kg(-1) in 0.2 mL saline) and another group received an equivalent volume
   of sterile saline. Animals from each group were killed on Days 0, 3, 4,
   5 or 6 after implant removal (PMSG, n = 4 per day; saline controls, n =
   3 per day). The uterus and vaginal cul-de-sac were excised and tissue
   was analysed for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and keratan sulfate content.
   GAG concentration increased progressively over the six-day period
   following implant removal. Mean uterine GAG concentrations were
   significantly higher than those in vaginal cul-de-sac from Day 3 to Day
   6 in PMSG-treated and saline-treated animals following progestagen
   implant removal (P < 0.05). Keratan sulfate concentrations showed a
   similar response-concentrations were higher in uterine tissue than in
   vaginal cul-de-sac tissue and PMSG-treated animals showed a greater
   response than did saline controls in the uterine tissue, but the same
   response in cul-de-sac tissue (P < 0.05 for all groups).
   The progressive increase in GAG concentrations of reproductive tract
   tissue following removal of the progesterone implant is indicative of
   hormonal stimulation and suggests that GAGs may have a supportive role
   in gamete and embryo nutrition and growth in the brushtail possum.},

Abstract = {Marsupial ova are slightly larger on average than those of eutherians.
   They have often been described as ``yolky{''}, although the nature and
   roles of their contents in later development are poorly understood. In
   the ova of all marsupial species studied, large quantities of
   electron-lucent Vesicles are present. This study describes the
   ultrastructure of oogenesis in the brushtail possum, Trichosurus
   vulpecula. Oocytes of primordial follicles contain a variety of
   organelles of unknown function, some of which have been described
   previously in bandicoots. Large electron-lucent Vesicles begin to
   accumulate after the transition from primordial follicle to primary
   follicle and are derived at least partly from the Golgi and endoplasmic
   reticulum. Other inclusions that are absent in some other marsupial
   species are present in growing possum oocytes in smaller quantities,
   including yolklike lipid bodies and electron-dense granular bodies. (C)

Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Social network analyses were used to investigate contact patterns in a
   free-living possum Trichosurus vulpecula population and to estimate the
   influence of contact on R-0 for bovine tuberculosis (TB). Using data
   collected during a five-year capture-mark-recapture study of a
   free-living possum population, observed estimates of R0 were computed
   and compared with R0 computed from random networks of similar size that
   approximated a random mixing process. All networks displayed a
   heterogeneous pattern of contact with the average number of contacts per
   possum ranging from 20 to 26 per year. The networks consistently showed
   small-world and single-scale features. The mean estimates of R0 for TB
   using the observed contact networks were 1.78, 1.53, 1.53, 1.51, and
   1.52 times greater than the corresponding random networks ( P < 0.05).
   We estimate that TB would spread if an average of between 1.94 and 1.97
   infective contacts occurred per year per infected possum, which is
   approximately half of that expected from a random network. These results
   have implications for the management of TB in New Zealand where the
   possum is the principal wildlife reservoir host of Mycobacterium bovis,
   the causal agent of bovine TB. This study argues the relevance of
   refining epidemiological models used to inform disease management policy
   to account for contact heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {All mammalian eggs are surrounded by the zona pellucida, an
   extracellular coat involved in vital functions during fertilization and
   early development. The zona pellucida glycoproteins are promising
   antigenic targets for development of contraceptive vaccines to control
   pest populations of marsupials in Australia and New Zealand. Our current
   understanding of the function of the zona pellucida glycoproteins is
   based almost entirely on the mouse and may not be representative of
   gamete interactions in all eutherian or marsupial mammals. This study
   reports the isolation and characterization of the ZP2 gene from the
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). The brushtail possum ZP2 mRNA
   is 2,182 nucleotides long with an open reading frame coding for a
   polypeptide chain of 712 amino acids with a molecular mass of 79,542 d.
   The deduced amino acid sequence of possum ZP2 is 48 to 55\% identical to
   that of eutherian mammals. It shares several structural characteristics
   including N-linked glycosylation sites, location and number of cysteine
   residues, and hydropathy profile. The brushtail possum ZP2 gene is
   expressed exclusively in the ovary. Further studies are planned to
   elucidate the specific site of ZP2 expression within the ovary and its
   function during fertilization in marsupials. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular coat that surrounds the
   mammalian egg, and serves as the primary recognition site for
   fertilizing spermatozoa. The timetable of ZP formation was examined in
   two marsupials, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and the brushtail
   possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) using conventional histological methods,
   immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Ovaries from tammar wallaby
   pouch young less than 80 days of age contained only primordial follicles
   with a single layer of flattened granulosa cells. There was no evidence
   of ZP formation until 98 days, when a small number of eggs surrounded by
   a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells had a ZP detectable by
   periodic-acid-schiff staining and rabbit anti-pig ZP polyclonal antibody
   labelling. Possum ovaries at 108 and 114 days also contained a small
   number of eggs with a ZP and a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells.
   The antibody also labelled the peripheral cytoplasm of oocytes at this
   stage and, occasionally, the granulosa cells. Antral follicles were
   first detected at 144 days in the wallaby and 125 days in the possum,
   and always contained an egg surrounded by a ZP. Ovaries from 147, 158,
   165, 181, 184 and 210-day-old tammar wallabies contained a range of
   follicle types from primordial through early antrum formation. Electron
   microscopy confirmed observations made at the light microscope level.
   The ZP was first detectable in small primary follicles with a single
   layer of cuboidal granulosa cells in areas where microvilli had begun to
   form on the egg plasma membrane. Immunogold labelling indicated the egg
   cytoplasm as the origin of the ZP proteins. The ZP completely filled the
   space between the egg and the adjacent granulosa cells in preantral
   follicles, so that there was no perivitelline space. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Journal = {BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION},
Year = {1991},

Abstract = {Previous studies of marsupial lactation have shown that the
   milk-ejection reflex changes in sensitivity, being greater in small
   mammary glands sucked by small pouch young and lesser in larger glands
   supplying milk to larger young. The involvement of oxytocin receptors in
   these changes was examined in the brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula
   Oxytocin receptors were measured in the mammary glands, uterus, and
   medial vaginal sacs by radioreceptor assay, using {[}H-3]oxytocin as
   radioligand. In the mammary gland, a single oxytocin binding site was
   found with an affinity and receptor concentration of 0.81 +/- 0.41
   l/nmol and 10.2 +/- 4.8 pmol/g tissue respectively (SD, 10 possums).
   Competitive displacement curves with related peptides and analogs showed
   the following order of specificity:
   d(CH2)5{[}Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr9-NH2]-vasotocin > > vasotocin > oxytocin =
   Arg-vasopressin > mesotocin > {[}Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin = Lys-vasopressin >
   {[}deamino-Pen1, O-methyl-Tyr2, Arg8]-vasopressin > isotocin >>
   {[}d(CH2)5, D-Phe2, Ile4, Ala9-NH2]-AVP. {[}H-3]Oxytocin did not bind to
   vasopressin receptors in the thoracic aorta. The concentration of
   oxytocin receptors was very high in small mammary glands (18.6 pmol/g
   tissue in a 2-g gland) and decreased logarithmically as the size of the
   mammary gland increased. It is suggested that the changes in the
   sensitivity of milk ejection to oxytocin is related to the concentration
   of mammary oxytocin receptors. The presence of oxytocin receptors in
   both uterus and median vaginal sacs extends previous observations and
   supports the hypothesis that in marsupial parturition, the uterus and
   medial vaginal sacs respond as a single functional unit to oxytocin.},

Abstract = {Immunocontraceptive vaccines against zona pellucida (ZP) proteins are
   being developed for brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) management
   in New Zealand. Mapping of B cell epitopes on the ZP2 protein of possums
   was undertaken in this study to define the antigenic regions that may be
   crucial to sperm-egg binding. The amino acid sequence of the full-length
   possum ZP2 protein (712 amino acids) was used to synthesize a complete
   set of 71 (15-mer) biotinylated peptides with an offset of five amino
   acids. The peptides were used in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) to identify continuous epitopes recognized by antibodies
   in the sera of possums immunized with recombinant possum ZP2 (rZP2)
   constructs. Seventeen continuous epitopes were located on possum ZP2
   protein. Comparisons of the peptide binding pattern of antibodies in
   individual sera with the fertility status of the same immunized possums
   revealed three significant infertility-relevant peptide epitopes (amino
   acids 111-125, 301-315, and 431-445). One of these (amino acids 431-445)
   bound to possum spermatozoa from the caudal epididymis. The implications
   of these findings for developing immunocontraceptive vaccines for possum
   control are discussed. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {This study examined the seasonal variation in ovarian response to the
   exogenous hormone pregnant mares serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) in the
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Ovarian stimulation was
   achieved by administration of a single intramuscular injection of 15 IU
   PMSG. Animals (n = 165) responded to this treatment in a variable manner
   depending on the month of the year. The maximum response (measured by
   the total number of large (>2 mm) follicles) was 15.8 +/- 1.5 follicles
   per animal (n = 12) in May and the minimum response was 4.9 +/- 1.6
   follicles per animal (n = 7) in January. The response throughout the
   rest of the year closely paralleled the birth seasonal distribution
   observed in wild possums in published reports. In the summer months
   (December, January and February) when few females carried pouch young,
   55\%, 42\% and 17\% of PMSG-primed animals, respectively, exhibited a
   nil response to PMSG (i.e. no follicles >2 mm were found on the ovaries
   of treated animals). In addition, when wild possums were in lactational
   anoestrus after the autumnal breeding peak, possums with a nil response
   to PMSG accounted for 17\% (July) and 6\% (August) of those treated, but
   the other animals gave near maximal numbers of large follicles (July,
   5-21; August, 2-25). Whether the ovaries of non-responders are
   downregulated in some manner outside the breeding season or they become
   insensitive to gonadotrophin remains to be investigated. These
   observations pinpoint times of the year when the highest productivity
   can be expected following PMSG treatment, and together with information
   on the timing of ovulation provide critical data for the development of
   artificial breeding strategies for the possum.},

Abstract = {A zymographic procedure using gelatin-sodium dodecylsulphate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (gelatin-SDS PAGE) has been optimized
   to study proacrosin/acrosin system in two species of marsupial, the
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the tammar wallaby
   (Macropus eugenii). One major protease digestion band at 50 kDa was
   detected on a gelatin-SDS PAGE for epididymal brushtail possum sperm
   acid extract compared to three major bands, 46, 38 and 32 kDa
   approximate weight for epididymal and ejaculated tammar wallaby sperm
   acid extract. A minor protease band of digestion at 66 kDa was also
   present in both these species. Preincubating the gels with 50-mM
   benzamidine completely inhibited the protease digestion, indicating that
   these are trypsin-like proteases. A zymogen form of acrosin, proacrosin,
   was detectable using a spectrophotometric assay to study the activation
   profile of the acid extracts in both species. Proacrosin activation to
   acrosin occurs maximally within 30 min and at pH 8.0. The total acrosin
   activity of sperm present in both species was found to be several-folds
   the activity found in eutherian sperm. No differences were found in
   proacrosin activation profile or total acrosin activity isolated from
   either epididymal or ejaculated spermatozoa in both these species. The
   importance of the study in relation to fertilization process in these
   species is discussed.},

Abstract = {We have cloned a cDNA containing the entire coding sequence of a
   marsupial (the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula) zona pellucida
   protein (ZPB). The open reading frame of 1,581 nt is predicted to encode
   a ZPB polypeptide of 527 amino acids which contains 20 cysteine
   residues, 7 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a potential
   N-terminal signal peptide and a potential C-terminal trans-membrane
   domain, preceded by a furin proteolytic processing signal. Sequence
   comparisons between possum ZPB and orthologous polypeptides from 7
   eutherian species and from Xenopus laevis, reveal the existence of a
   high degree of sequence similarity, particularly in the central portion
   of the molecule. Cysteine residues are highly conserved, and all nine
   species possess potential N-terminal signal peptide sequences and
   C-terminal transmembrane domains of approximately the same length. In
   situ hybridisation revealed that expression of ZPB was restricted to
   oocytes of primordial and primary follicles of adult possums; no
   expression was detected in the surrounding granulosa cells. The broad
   conservation of ZPB sequence, structure and expression over a wide range
   of mammalian species, revealed by our studies, makes it unlikely that
   these features account far the different properties of the marsupial and
   eutherian zona pellucidae. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 52:174-182, 1999. (C) 1999

Abstract = {The bacterial composition of the brustail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula)
   pouch was characterized throughout the reproductive cycle using
   brushtails from an Australian captive breeding colony (45 swabs) and a
   wild population in New Zealand (26 swabs). Gram-positive coccal species
   predominate throughout the reproductive cycle. Enteric Gram-negative
   rods, particularly Escherichia coli, were most prevalent when a pouch
   young was present and was most likely the result of faecal contamination
   from the pouch young. As culturing is only able to detect a proportion
   of bacteria present in a particular environment, molecular 16S rDNA
   sequencing was carried out-on DNA extracted from a pouch wash of a
   female carrying a pouch young to gain a more accurate assessment of the
   pouch microflora. This approach identified approximately five times the
   number of bacterial species when compared to culture results. The
   majority detected were Gram negative rods or most closely related to
   Gram-negative rods species. Brushtails are immunologically immature at
   birth yet-survive in a pouch colonised with potentially pathogenic
   bacteria. A haemagglutination assay was used to determine whether
   antibodies to a frequently isolated bacterium (Klebsiella pneumoniae)
   were transferred via milk from mother to pouch young. IgG antibodies
   were detected in maternal serum, milk and pouch young serum. In young
   over 70 days, antibody-titres were significantly higher than those found
   in maternal serum, suggesting that the young is capable of producing
   adult type antibodies to pouch bacteria at this time. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {Mast cells are typically associated with biological responses to
   intracellular parasitic or bacterial invasion in gut and pulmonary
   tissues. Large numbers of these cells are present in the vaginal
   cul-de-sac, a component of the reproductive tract in female brushtail
   possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). The presence of mast cells in this area
   may reflect microbial presence or indicate a role for mast cells in
   reproductive function in this marsupial. In this study, the number and
   spatial location of mast cells in vaginal cul-de-sac tissues at
   different reproductive stages was determined, and related to the
   presence of microflora. Vaginal cul-de-sac tissue was collected from
   juvenile (n = 5), lactationally anoestrous and cyclic adult brushtail
   possums (n = 6 per group). Oestrous cyclicity was induced by removal of
   pouch young and reproductive status was confirmed by laparoscopy. Tissue
   was collected aseptically for microbiological procedures. The
   fractionator and optical disector stereological methods were used to
   quantify mast cell populations. In all groups, microflora populations
   were low (< 5 X 10(5) organisms g(-1)). Mast cell density in epithelial
   tissue was highest in lactationally anoestrous and luteal phase
   brushtail possums and lowest in follicular phase animals. No correlation
   between the numbers of bacteria isolated and mast cell density was
   apparent. Gram stained tissue showed no evidence of bacterial invasion.
   Mast cell density was significantly lower in epithelial tissue from
   follicular phase animals, corroborating previous studies in which an
   increase in mast cell degranulation coincided with high oestrogen
   concentrations.},

Abstract = {The time course of nuclear maturation of oocytes was examined in
   brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula. Oocytes were recovered from
   ovarian follicles > 2 mm in diameter after pregnant mares' serum
   gonadotrophin/porcine luteinizing hormone (PMSG/LH) treatment (in vivo
   matured) or 72 hr after PMSG treatment (in vitro matured). Oocytes
   recovered from small (<2 mm) and large (>2 mm) follicles were also
   assessed for their ability to mature in vitro. Staining with the
   DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33342 was used to assess the stage of nuclear
   development by fluorescence microscopy. The process of nuclear
   maturation progressed rapidly in vivo, as oocytes collected at 20-27 hr
   post-LH all had a GV, but by 28-29.5 hr post-LH approximately a third of
   eggs were MII. By 30-hr post-LH, more than 70\% of oocytes had reached
   MII stage and all ovulated eggs were MII. In vitro, all oocytes were at
   germinal vesicle stage at the start of culture. After 24 hr of culture,
   67\% of oocytes had progressed to metaphase I/anaphase I of meiosis.
   After 36 hr, 25\% of oocytes had completed maturation to metaphase II,
   increasing to 52\% after 48 hr. Maturation of oocytes after 48 hr in
   culture was unaffected by the presence or absence of granulosa cells,
   PMSG or LH/porcine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). More oocytes from
   large follicles (55\%) completed maturation by 48 hr than from small
   follicles (15\%). The potential of oocytes to mature after 48 hr in
   culture was dependent on the follicle harvested having reaching a
   critical diameter of 1.5 mm. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {In the brushtail possum oocyte, vesicles accumulate in a polarized
   fashion at the vegetal pole and cytoplasm rich in mitochondria and
   containing the germinal vesicle comprise the animal pole. During
   cleavage to early blastocyst stages, animal pole cytoplasm locates to
   the cells of the embryonic hemisphere (pluriblast) and vegetal pole
   vesicular cytoplasm to cells of the abembryonic hemisphere
   (trophoblast). Previously identified 16 amino acid residues, associated
   with the vesicle-rich cytoplasm were used for molecular cloning and
   characterization of a vesicle associated protein, VAP1. The degenerate
   primer was used in a TRACE for vap1 gene cloning. The cDNA encoding VAP1
   was 516 bp in length with no significant homologies and coded for 172
   amino acid residues for the mature protein. The N-terminal domain of
   VAP1 showed a structural homology to the cysteine protease inhibitor,
   Cystatin. Gene expression studies during oogenesis revealed that vap1
   had an ovary-specific, possibly oocyte-specific expression, which occurs
   during follicle formation and growth and in adult ovaries. Recombinant
   VAP1 fusion protein generated polyclonal antibodies in the mouse and in
   the brushtail possum. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A reorientation of the sperm head so that it is perpendicular to the
   sperm tail (i.e., T-shape or thumbtack) is considered an indicator of
   sperm capacitation in the Australian marsupial the brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula). This study describes a method of oviduct
   epithelial cell monolayer and sperm coculture in the brushtail possum to
   obtain a high percentage of thumbtack sperm. The oviduct epithelial cell
   (OEC) monolayers were prepared in vitro from the isthmal and ampullary
   segments of eCG- and LH-primed brushtail possum oviducts. Coculture
   experiments demonstrated that cauda epididymidal sperm from the
   brushtail possum attached equally to the OEC monolayers derived from the
   isthmal and ampullary segments of the oviduct. After 2 h of coculture, a
   large number of sperm attached to OEC monolayers (ampulla, 60.1 +/-
   4.7\% and isthmus, 63.1 +/- 5.7\%) as well as to controls (tracheal
   epithelial cell monolayer, 46.2 +/- 3.7\%; Matrigel, 57.4 +/- 7.7\%;
   plastic, 29.2 +/- 3.2\%). After 6 h, fewer sperm were attached to
   tracheal epithelial cell monolayers (1.2 +/- 0.2\%; P < 0.01) and
   Matrigel (10.2 +/- 2.5\%; P < 0.01), compared to those attached to
   ampullary and isthmal OEC monolayers (37.9 +/- 7.2\% and 44.6 +/- 2.2\%,
   respectively), and none were attached to the plastic surface. Fewer
   sperm were released from the ampullary and isthmal OEC monolayers
   compared to those from controls (P < 0.05). At 6 h of coculture with
   ampullary and isthmal OEC, the percentage motility of both attached and
   unattached spermatozoa was maintained at 40-50\%, which was higher (P <
   0.05) than in controls. Progressive motility of unattached sperm was
   maintained at about 2 ton an arbitrary scale of 1-5) and was not
   different among treatments until 6 h. More than 60-70\% sperm were
   viable at 6 h of coculture in all the treatments. Coculture of brushtail
   possum epididymal sperm with OEC monolayers transformed 60\% of motile
   streamlined spermatozoa to thumbtack orientation at 2 h compared to
   approximately 25\% in controls. No acrosomal modifications were induced
   in spermatozoa in any of the treatments. This study has demonstrated a
   role of the oviduct in transforming a large number of sperm from a
   streamlined to thumbtack orientation, which may have relevance in sperm
   capacitation and fertilization in this species.},

Title = {Non-invasive placentation in the marsupials <i>Macropus eugenii</i>

   redistribution of uterine Desmoglein-2},

Abstract = {In mammalian pregnancy, the uterus is remodeled to become receptive to
   embryonic implantation. Since non-invasive placentation in marsupials is
   likely derived from invasive placentation, and is underpinned by
   intra-uterine conflict between mother and embryo, species with
   non-invasive placentation may employ a variety of molecular mechanisms
   to maintain an intact uterine epithelium and to prevent embryonic
   invasion. Identifying such modifications to the uterine epithelium of
   marsupial species with non-invasive placentation is key to understanding
   how conflict is mediated during pregnancy in different mammalian groups.
   Desmoglein-2, involved in maintaining lateral cell-cell adhesion of the
   uterine epithelium, is redistributed before implantation to facilitate
   embryo invasion in mammals with invasive placentation. We identified
   localization patterns of this cell adhesion molecule throughout
   pregnancy in two marsupial species with non-invasive placentation, the
   tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii; Macropodidae), and the brushtail
   possum (Trichosurus vulpecula; Phalangeridae). Interestingly,
   Desmoglein-2 redistribution also occurs in both M. eugenii and T.
   vulpecula, suggesting that cell adhesion, and thus integrity of the
   uterine epithelium, is reduced during implantation regardless of
   placental type, and may be an important component of uterine remodeling.
   Desmoglein-2 also localizes to the mesenchymal stromal cells of M.
   eugenii and to epithelial cell nuclei in T. vulpecula, suggesting its
   involvement in cellular processes that are independent of adhesion and
   may compensate for reduced lateral adhesion in the uterine epithelium.
   We conclude that non-invasive placentation in marsupials involves
   diverse and complementary strategies to maintain an intact epithelial
   barrier.},

Abstract = {Pregnancy in mammals requires remodeling of the uterus to become
   receptive to the implanting embryo. Remarkably similar morphological
   changes to the uterine epithelium occur in both eutherian and marsupial
   mammals, irrespective of placental type. Nevertheless, molecular
   differences in uterine remodeling indicate that the marsupial uterus
   employs maternal defences, including molecular reinforcement of the
   uterine epithelium, to regulate embryonic invasion. Non-invasive
   (epitheliochorial) embryonic attachment in marsupials likely evolved
   secondarily from invasive attachment, so uterine defences in these
   species may prevent embryonic invasion. We tested this hypothesis by
   identifying localization patterns of Talin, a key basal anchoring
   molecule, in the uterine epithelium during pregnancy in the tammar
   wallaby (Macropus eugenii; Macropodidae) and the brush tail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula; Phalangeridae). Embryonic attachment is
   non-invasive in both species, yet Talin undergoes a clear distributional
   change during pregnancy in M. eugenii, including recruitment to the base
   of the uterine epithelium just before attachment, that closely resembles
   that of invasive implantation in the marsupial species Sminthopsis
   crassicaudata. Basal localization occurs throughout pregnancy in T.
   vulpecula, although, as for M. eugenii, this pattern is most specific
   prior to attachment. Such molecular reinforcement of the uterine
   epithelium for non-invasive embryonic attachment in marsupials supports
   the hypothesis that less-invasive and non-invasive embryonic attachment
   in marsupials may have evolved via accrual of maternal defences.
   Recruitment of basal molecules, including Talin, to the uterine
   epithelium may have played a key role in this transition.},

Abstract = {In certain Australian marsupials including the tammar wallaby (Macrapus
   eugenii) and the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), formation of
   the acrosome is not completed in the testis but during a complex
   differentiation process as spermatozoa pass through the epididymis.
   Using transmission and scanning electron microscopy this paper defined
   the process of acrosome formation in the epididymis, providing temporal
   and spatial information on the striking reorganisation of the acrosomal
   membranes and matrix and of the overlying sperm surface involved. On
   leaving the testis wallaby and possum spermatozoa had elongated
   `scoop'-shaped acrosomes projecting from the dorsal surface of the head.
   During passage down the epididymis, this structure condensed into the
   compact button-like organelle found on ejaculated spermatozoa. This
   condensation was achieved by a complex process of infolding and fusion
   of the lateral projections of the `scoop'. In the head of the epididymis
   the rims of the lateral scoop projections became shorter and thickened
   and folded inwards, to eventually meet midway along the longitudinal
   axis of the acrosome. As spermatozoa passed through the body of the
   epididymis the lateral projections fused together. Evidence of this
   fusion of the immature outer acrosomal membrane is the presence of
   vesicles within the acrosomal matrix which persist even in ejaculated
   spermatozoa. When spermatozoa have reached the tail of the epididymis
   the acrosome condenses into its mature form, as a small button-like
   structure contained within the depression on the anterior end of the
   nucleus. During the infolding process, the membranes associated with the
   immature acrosome are either engulfed into the acrosomal matrix (outer
   acrosomal membrane), or eliminated from the sperm head as tubular
   membrane elements (cytoplasmic membrane). Thus the surface and
   organelles of the testicular sperm head are transient structures in
   those marsupials with posttesticular acrosome formation and this must be
   taken into consideration in attempts to dissect the cell and molecular
   biology of fertilisation.},

Abstract = {Ovarian development and function have been extensively studied in
   eutherian species, with stem cell factor and its receptor, c-kit, having
   been shown to play key roles at various stages of these processes. In
   contrast, relatively little is known regarding ovarian development in
   marsupials. The aims of this study were, first, to establish the timing
   of key events during germ. cell. maturation and follicular development
   and, second, to determine the timing and cellular localization of gene
   expression for c-kit in the ovaries of a marsupial, the brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula). For this study, ovaries were collected from
   possums ranging in age from Day I after birth to adult. Using
   stereology, the number of germ cells was found to increase rapidly
   during the first 60-100 days of life. This was followed by a sharp
   decline in number, wherein almost 90\% of germ cells had disappeared by
   Day 180. From histological examinations, the time of initiation of
   meiosis, follicular formation, and follicular growth were determined to
   occur on Days 35, 50, and 60, respectively. Using in situ hybridization,
   c-kit gene expression was localized to germ cells and somatic cells
   during the first 15 days of life; however, after Day 30 and into adult
   life, c-kit expression was exclusive to germ cells. Results from this
   study suggest that the pattern of ovarian development is similar in
   marsupials to eutherians, and that c-kit may play a key role in germ
   cell development at various stages throughout life.},

Abstract = {The testicular androgen 5 alpha- androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol (
   androstanediol) mediates virilisation in pouch young of a marsupial, the
   tammar wallaby, and is the principal androgen formed in immature rodent
   testes. To chart the pattern of androstanediol formation in another
   marsupial species, the testes or fragments of testes from brushtail
   possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) that spanned the age range from early
   pouch young to mature adults were incubated with H-3-progesterone and
   the products were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography.
   The only 19-carbon steroids identified in pouch young and adult testes
   were the Delta(4)-3-keto-steroids testosterone and androstenedione.
   However, androstanediol and another 5a- reduced androgen ( androsterone)
   were synthesised by testes from Day 87-200 males and these appeared to
   be formed from the 5 alpha-reduction and 3-keto reduction of
   testosterone and androstenedione. In the prostate and glans penis of the
   immature male, H-3-androstanediol was converted to dihydrotestosterone.
   We conclude that the timing of androstanediol formation in the possum
   testis resembles the process in rodents rather than in the tammar
   wallaby and that any androstanediol in the circulation probably acts in
   target tissues via conversion to dihydrotestosterone.},

Title = {Presence of males affects the incidence of ovulation after pouch young

Abstract = {The traditional method for inducing and synchronising oestrus in the
   brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is by removal of their suckling
   pouch young (RPY). However, our studies have recently shown that, in
   addition to wide variation between animals in the time of ovulation
   after RPY, a proportion of animals failed to ovulate, Evidence from
   several mammalian species indicates that the presence of males can
   stimulate ovarian activity and synchronise oestrus in females. The aim
   of this study was to determine the effect of the male on the oestrous
   cycle of the female brushtail possum after RPY. A total of 67 adult
   female brushtail possums were treated as three replicates. In order to
   observe the day of preovulatory follicle emergence and ovulation,
   animals underwent laparoscopic examination at 1-4 day intervals over a
   period from 0-21 days after RPY. The first replicate(N= 18, May/June
   1995) involved only animals kept in isolation from males, whereas the
   two remaining replicates compared ovarian responses between animals kept
   with (N= 10, July 1995; N=14, June 1996) or in isolation from (N= 10,
   July 1995; N=15, June 1996) males. The incidence of ovulation after RPY
   was significantly higher in females that were housed with males than in
   those kept in isolation from mares (100\%, 92.8\% vs. 50.0\%, 66.7\%,
   14.3\%; P < 0.001). Every animal that ovulated, had previously had a
   preovulatory follicle present at the site where the corpus luteum
   formed. Conversely, none of the animals that failed to ovulate,
   developed a preovulatory follicle during the period of study. The range
   of mean day of preovulatory follicle emergence (6.00-6.86 days), of
   ovulation (11.80- 12.20 days) and the synchrony of ovulation between
   animals (range 8-17 days) after RPY, were not significantly affected by
   the presence of males. This study demonstrates for the first time. that
   the presence of males significantly increases the incidence of ovulation
   after RPY in the brushtail possum. However neither the timing of
   reproductive events nor the synchrony of ovulation were affected by
   presence of the male. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {In this review comparisons are made between gonadal development and
   function in two species, the sheep and the brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula), which represent examples of eutherians and metatherians,
   respectively. In sheep most stages of gonadal development (e.g. sexual
   differentiation, meiosis, follicular formation and initiation of
   follicular growth) occur during fetal life, whereas in the brushtail
   possum these stages occur after birth. However, the time frames (e.g.
   days) over which these developmental stages occur are similar between
   the two species.
   Ovarian function between sheep and brushtail possums appears to differ
   with respect to the ability of somatic cells to synthesize steroids;
   this may be related to the relative contribution of the ovarian rete and
   medullary cords to the developing gonad in sheep and brushtail possums,
   respectively. In both species the timing of expression of mRNA and/or
   peptide for c-kit, c-kit ligand and alpha-subunit of inhibin during
   follicular growth appear to be the same. Nevertheless, there are many
   gaps in our knowledge of growth factors during gonadal development,
   especially in the brushtail possum. It is concluded that the pouch-young
   brushtail possum has several advantages over the sheep as an
   experimental model for the study of gonadal development.},

Abstract = {Gametes from the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), an Australian
   marsupial, require exposure to oviductal cells and/or their secretions
   before sperm binding and penetration of the zona pellucida can occur.
   Sperm-egg fusion, the next critical step in fertilization has not
   previously been reported in vitro. Here we describe the refinement of an
   oviduct epithelial cell (OEC) explant culture system using two different
   media to obtain in vitro sperm-egg fusion in the brushtail possum for
   the first time. Conditioned media from OEC explant cultures were
   supplemented with either 1\% fetal calf serum (FCS) or 1 mg/ml polyvinyl
   alcohol and used for co-culture of epididymal sperm and superovulated
   eggs. Under these conditions zona penetration rates varied from 0 to
   46\% and sperm-egg fusion from 0 to 20\%. Analysis of explant
   conditioned media indicated that qualitative and quantitative
   differences between batches could account, at least partially, for the
   large variability in zona penetration rates. Conditioned media that
   contained approximately 1 mM of ionic calcium were most effective for
   achieving sperm capacitation, zona binding, and penetration and
   sperm-egg fusion. The reorientation of the sperm head to T-shape, an
   indicator of capacitation in the brushtail possum, was closely linked
   with the concentration of calcium present in vitro.},

Title = {Responses of male brushtail possums to sterile females: implications for

Abstract = {1. Increasingly immunocontraception is being considered as a potential
   method for the biological control of mammalian pests. Although several
   studies have investigated or modelled its demographic consequences,
   there have been few studies of the possible effects of the presence of
   sterile females on local males.
   2. In New Zealand, the brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula is an
   important mammalian pest, for which immunocontraception has been
   proposed as a control method.
   3. We surgically sterilized female brushtail possums in two populations
   to study the potential effects of immunocontraception on body condition
   and local sex ratios.
   4. Large numbers of leucocytes (indicating oestrus) were present in the
   reproductive tracts of sterile female possums several weeks after most
   control (non-sterile) females were pregnant and had ceased mating
   activity. This indicates that the sterilization of females prolonged the
   mating season of local possums.
   5. The body condition of males was significantly poorer in the presence
   of sterilized females in the winter post-mating period following the
   treatment. In contrast, the body condition of females showed no change
   following the sterilization treatment, either during the autumn mating
   period or in the winter post-mating period.
   6. More adult male possums were recorded at both study sites after the
   sterilization treatment, resulting in a change to the originally
   female-biased sex ratio. This may have been caused by the prolonged
   presence of oestrous females attracting males from surrounding areas.
   7. The implications of our results for the control of possums by
   sexually transmitted immunocontraception are twofold. First, the reduced
   body condition of males in the presence of sterilized females might
   result in increased male mortality. Secondly, the attraction of males
   from surrounding areas to those containing sterilized females might
   facilitate the local spread of an immunocontraceptive agent.
   8. We advocate further assessments of the effects of sterilization
   and/or immunocontraception on the population demography, individual
   condition and survival of pest animals.},

Abstract = {in a previous study, three infertility-relevant epitopes of possum ZP2
   (Pep12 (amino acids 111-125), Pep31 (amino acids 301-315), and Pep44
   (amino acids 431-445)) were identified using sera from possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) immunized with recombinant possum zona pellucida
   2 (ZP2) constructs, and a synthetic peptide library of possum ZP2
   protein. In this study, the three peptides were conjugated to keyhole
   limpet hemocyanin and 300 mu g of each conjugated peptide were
   administered subcutaneously to female possums (n= 20 per peptide) in
   complete Freund's adjuvant. Immunogen doses were repeated 3 and 6 weeks
   later using incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Control animals were immunized
   with either phosphate-buffered saline only (n= 10) or 300 mu g keyhole
   limpet hemocyanin (n= 10), administered with the same adjuvants. Serum
   antibodies from animals immunized against these three epitopes bound to
   the corresponding possum ZP2 peptides, recombinant possum ZP2 protein
   constructs, and native zona. Possum fertility was assessed following
   superovulation and artificial insemination. Peptides Pep12 and Pep31 had
   no significant effects on fertility parameters (P > 0.05). However,
   animals immunized with Pep44 had lower egg fertilization rates
   (immunized 19.5\% versus control 60.5\%, P < 0.05) and produced
   significantly fewer embryos than control animals (immunized 0.5 embryos
   versus control 2.4 embryos, P < 0.05). The number of Pep44-immunized
   females that produced embryos was reduced by 64\%. identification and
   characterization of possum infertility-relevant epitopes on possum ZP2
   protein will assist development of safe, humane, and possum-specific
   immunocontraceptive vaccines for controlling the introduced possums in
   New Zealand.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate a role of a recently
   discovered marsupial nidovirus in the development of a neurological
   disease, termed wobbly possum disease (WPD), in the Australian brushtail
   possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Four possums received 1 mL of a standard
   inoculum that had been prepared from tissues of WPD-affected possums, 4
   possums received 1.8 mL (1 x 10(6) TCID50) of a cell lysate from
   inoculated cultures, and 4 possums received 1 mL (x 10(7) TCID50) of a
   purified WPD isolate. All but one possum that received infectious
   inocula developed neurological disease and histopathological lesions
   characteristic for WPD. High levels of viral RNA were detected in livers
   from all possums that received infectious inocula, but not from control
   possums. Altogether, our data provide strong experimental evidence for
   the causative involvement of WPD virus in development of a neurological
   disease in infected animals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Artificial insemination of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) is
   being developed as an assisted breeding model for endangered marsupials,
   as well as a bioassay for testing fertility control vaccines to manage
   overabundant populations. Procedures were optimised in animals
   superovulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) and porcine
   luteinising hormone (pLH). Of three intervals examined, yields were
   maximal following uterine insemination at 27-29.5 h after pLH treatment
   (four eggs, two to three embryos per female). Compared with no
   insemination, uterine-inseminated animals ovulated 30-36 h rather than
   28-34 h after pLH treatment. For the vaginal route, yields were maximal
   following insemination at 10-13 h after pLH treatment (six to seven
   eggs, four embryos per female) than at five other intervals, and when
   using acclimatised females during the autumn breeding season. This
   protocol was suitable for testing fertility control vaccines in
   April-June and was influenced by the housing location of animals, the
   presence of an active corpus luteum and PMSG batch, but not other
   factors ( year of trial, Freund's adjuvant treatment, changes in
   bodyweight, dose of PMSG kg(-1)). Embryos developed to the eight- to
   16-cell or unilaminar blastocyst stage after uterine or vaginal
   insemination, respectively. With the timing of artificial insemination
   optimised, new methods to synchronise or induce oestrus and ovulation
   are required to achieve year-round testing of fertility control vaccines
   or birth of offspring.},

Abstract = {The flagellum of a mammalian spermatozoon consists of a central axoneme
   surrounded by two cytoskeletal structures, the outer dense fibres and
   the fibrous sheath, which may aid in sperm motility or stability. In
   this study the outer dense fibres and fibrous sheath were isolated and
   partially characterized in a marsupial species, the brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula). Spermatozoa from the cauda epididymidis were
   decapitated by sonication, and the head and tail fractions were
   separated by centrifugation over a 20, 40 and 60\% (w/v) sucrose density
   gradient. After confirming sperm tail purity by Nomarski microscopy, the
   tails were incubated in either SDS-dithiothreitol to isolate the outer
   dense fibres or urea-dithiothreitol to isolate the fibrous sheaths.
   Purified outer dense fibres and fibrous sheaths were solubilized in SDS
   and S-mercaptoethanol and proteins were separated by one-dimensional
   PACE. Coomassie blue staining showed that the outer dense fibres were
   composed of seven major proteins (molecular masses: 73, 58, 55, 54, 52,
   41 and 16 kDa), and the fibrous sheath was composed of: 12 major
   proteins (molecular masses: 106, 76, 66, 62, 55, 53, 52, 46, 40, 30, 28
   and 16 kDa). A polyclonal antibody to the fibrous sheath proteins showed
   strong crossreactivity with those of fibrous sheath from spermatozoa of
   several other marsupial species, as well as those from laboratory rats.
   Subsequent western blotting identified the immunoreactive 76 and 62 kDa
   proteins from all species, thus indicating their high conservation
   between species. No crossreactivity of the fibrous sheath antibody to
   any other cytoskeletal structures, including the outer dense fibres,
   mid-piece fibre network or connecting laminae, or to the acrosome or
   underlying subacrosomal material, was evident, indicating that the
   fibrous sheath proteins are localized to this structure alone. Further
   work is in progress to determine the extent of homology of these
   proteins to those in eutherian mammals.},

Abstract = {A reverse transcription technique using RNA, templates combined with
   polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to clone the cDNA fragment
   encoding the amino acid sequence of mature LIF protein of the marsupial,
   the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula. A PCR product with expected
   size, of 546 bp, and termed tvLIF, was obtained using cDNA
   reverse-transcribed from total RNA isolated from possum uterus. A
   genomic DNA fragment (about 650 bp) between the specified primers was
   also amplified, indicating the similarity in structure and organization
   of this gene and LIF genes from studied eutherian species, although the
   full-length of its cDNA and genomic DNA needs to be further clarified.
   The deduced amino acid sequence of tvLIF shows a high level of sequence
   identity and similar molecular characteristics to eutherian LIF, which
   suggests similar biological actions of this molecule in this marsupial.
   Because the expression of LIF gene in other mammalian species has been
   found to be at very low levels and its transcripts cannot be detected by
   Northern hybridization analysis, the expression pattern of tvLIF in
   adult tissues and reproductive tracts during early development was
   investigated using the RT-PCR technique. Resultant products of the
   RT-PCR were further analyzed by Southern hybridization using tvLIF as a
   probe, tvLIF transcripts were detected in most of the adult tissues and
   in the reproductive tracts of pregnant females. These results lend
   support to the idea that LIF contributes to the maintenance of pregnancy
   in this marsupial. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An important component of reintroduction is acclimatization to the
   release site. Movement parameters and breeding are common metrics used
   to infer the end of the acclimatization period, but the time taken to
   locate preferred food items is another important measure. We studied the
   diet of a reintroduced population of brushtail possums Trichosurus
   vulpecula in semi-arid South Australia over a 12 month period,
   investigating changes over time as well as the general diet. We used
   next-generation DNA sequencing to determine the contents of 253 scat
   samples, after creating a local plant reference library. Vegetation
   surveys were conducted monthly to account for availability. Dietary
   diversity and richness decreased significantly with time since release
   after availability was accounted for. We used Jacob's Index to assess
   selectivity; just 13.4\% of available plant genera were significantly
   preferred overall, relative to availability. The mean proportion of
   preferred plant genera contained within individual samples increased
   significantly with time since release, but the frequency of occurrence
   of preferred plants did not. Five genera (Eucalyptus, Petalostylis,
   Maireana, Zygophyllum and Callitris) were present in more than half of
   samples. There was no difference in dietary preferences between sexes
   (Pianka overlap = 0.73). Our results suggest that acclimatization
   periods may be longer than those estimated via reproduction, changes in
   mass and movement parameters, but that under suitable conditions a
   changeable diet should not negatively affect reintroduction outcomes.
   Reintroduction projects should aim to extend post-release monitoring
   beyond the dietary acclimatization period and, for dry climates, diet
   should be monitored through a drought period.},

Abstract = {Release methods can influence the outcome of reintroductions. We tested
   the effect of delayed, immediate and supplementary food/shelter release
   treatments on the reintroduction of brushtail possums Trichosurus
   vulpecula to an environment in which introduced predators, particularly
   foxes, were subject to control. Monitoring of 48 radio-collared possums
   over 3 months revealed that immediate release possums settled into a
   stable range significantly faster than other groups, but there were no
   differences in survival, dispersal distance, reproduction or body
   condition. Ten days after release possums from all treatment groups had
   lost body mass, but by day 60 most were heavier than at the time of
   translocation. After release, possums sometimes used shelter sites
   easily accessible to predators, but within 3 weeks they regularly
   selected safer shelter. Risky shelter selection and loss of condition
   immediately after release suggests that supplementary food and shelter
   could be beneficial, but supportive measures were rarely used or did not
   have the desired effect. In an environment with higher predator
   densities, risky shelter selection could lead to high post-release
   predation, and mass loss could encourage animals to forage in riskier
   ways, further increasing vulnerability. In these environments effective
   uptake of supplementary food and shelter could reduce predation risk,
   but supplementary measures would need to be presented in a way that
   maximises uptake. In contrast, if post-release predation risk is low
   then supportive measures may not be required. Innovative methods for
   providing post-release support should continue to be developed for
   reintroductions to areas where supportive measures are needed.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {The fluid in the vaginal cul-de-sac of the brushtail possum, Trichosurus
   vulpecula, is copious at ovulation when it may be involved in sperm
   transport or maturation, but is rapidly reabsorbed following ovulation.
   We have used the Ussing short-circuit current (I-sc) technique and
   measurements of transcript and protein expression of the epithelial Na+
   channel (ENaC) to determine if variations in electrogenic Na+ transport
   are associated with this fluid absorption. Spontaneous I-sc (<20 mu
   Acm(-2) during anoestrus, 60-80 mu Acm(-2) in cycling animals) was
   inhibited by serosal ouabain. Mucosal amiloride (10 mu molL(-1)), an
   inhibitor of ENaC, had little effect on follicular I-sc but reduced
   luteal I-sc by similar to 35\%. This amiloride-sensitive I-sc was
   dependent on mucosal Na+ and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration
   (IC50)-amiloride (0.95molL(-1)) was consistent with ENaC-mediated Na+
   absorption. Results from polymerase chain reaction with reverse
   transcription (RT-PCR) indicate that ENaC mRNA is expressed in
   anoestrous, follicular and luteal phases. However, in follicular animals
   ENaC immunoreactivity in epithelial cells was distributed throughout the
   cytoplasm, whereas immunoreactivity was restricted to the apical pole of
   cells from luteal animals. These data suggest that increased Na+
   absorption contributes to fluid absorption during the luteal phase and
   is regulated by insertion of ENaC into the apical membrane of cul-de-sac
   epithelial cells.},

Abstract = {In marsupials, the mechanisms of lineage allocation into pluriblast and
   trophoblast are related to conceptus polarity and polarized discharge of
   extracellular matrix (ECM). The brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula,
   a major pest species in New Zealand, is being intensively studied to
   develop an immunocontraceptive control method. Of 23 specimens examined,
   11 were examined by electron microscopy to study the presence and role
   of the ECM in lineage allocation in the possum.
   A number of polarized features in the zygote identified the future
   embryonic and abembryonic poles. Pronuclei, in a broad band of
   mitochondrion-rich cortical cytoplasm, lay in the embryonic hemisphere,
   and numerous electron-lucent vesicles characterized the abembryonic
   cytoplasm. These vesicles seemed to contribute to the ECM. During
   cleavage, cells lay near the zona in the embryonic hemisphere, and ECM
   accumulated chiefly in the abembryonic hemisphere. Cell-zona adhesion
   facilitated by microvillous and club processes occurred at the early
   4-cell stage, and cell-cell adhesion commenced at the late 4-cell stage.
   The first two cleavages were meridional, equal, and accompanied by
   elimination into the cleavage cavity of much of the electron-lucent
   vesicular material in the form of several membrane-bound yolk masses.
   The third cleavage was unequal, with both meridional and latitudinal
   planes. The first differences between trophoblast and pluriblast
   lineages appeared at the 8-cell stage. Later cleavage planes were
   latitudinal or oblique. Conceptus polarity, polarized discharge of ECM,
   and localized cell-zona adhesion were related to the first lineage
   allocation in the possum. Mel. Reprod. Dev. 50.420-433, 1998. (C) 1998

Title = {SPONTANEOUS OR EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED FORMATION OF A SPECIAL ZONE IN THE

Abstract = {The cytology and ultrastructure of the hypertrophied special zone, which
   is formed spontaneously in the adrenal cortex of adult female
   brush-tailed possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), was compared to the
   adrenocortical tissue in adult males in which the special zone, normally
   absent, was induced following castration alone or by additional
   treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
   The special zone in females was situated between the zona fasciculata
   and the zona reticularis, the latter being a rudimentary zone in this
   species.  Special zone tissue extended as a broad band parallel to and
   on one side of the adrenal medulla.  In the luteal phase of the
   reproductive cycle, the special zone cells showed ultrastructural
   features commonly associated with steroidogenic tissues, with many
   mitochondria and compact masses of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 
   Cytoplasmic lipid inclusions were rarely observed.  In lactating
   females, however, the special zone cells exhibited cytological and
   ultrastructural features suggestive of a transformation in their
   morphology broadly divided into two types of cells:  (1) cells at the
   periphery of the special zone (closest to the zona fasciculata) showed
   variable quantities of lipid inclusions, mitochondria with dispersed
   cristae, and segregation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into
   compact masses; (2) cells within the more central regions showed an
   increasing abundance of lipid inclusions which in many cells became the
   dominant feature of the cytoplasm.  These special zone cells contained
   very little smooth endoplasmic reticulum and their mitochondria
   contained few cristae together with amorphous granular material within
   the matrix.
   In castrated males, special zone tissue developed between the zona
   fasciculata and the zona reticularis, appearing initially as focal
   islands of cells (8 months postcastration) and later (11 months
   postcastration) expanding into a single zone, probably via the
   proliferation and differentiation of adjacent cells of the zona
   fasciculata and longitudinal growth of the special zone.  Similar focal
   aggregations of special zone cells were induced after 14 days of FSH
   treatment given to 2-month castrated males.  In all castrated and
   FSH-treated castrated males, the ultrastructure of special zone cells
   was similar to that of special zone cells in luteal-phase female
   possums.
   The findings suggest that the formation and cellular composition of the
   special zone is associated with changes in the pituitary-gonadal axis
   and that FSH plays a primary role in the differentiation of this tissue.},

   vaccine system for mucosal delivery to possums and the effects on possum

Abstract = {Several morphological features of early development differ between
   marsupials and eutherians. These include early overt conceptus polarity,
   the mode of segregation of pluriblast and trophoblast lineages, and the
   superficial position of the pluriblast within the unilaminar blastocyst
   epithelium. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of early development
   is lacking in marsupials. We have cloned from the brushtail possum,
   Trichosurus vulpecula, the partial cDNA of a marsupial homologue of
   mammalian POU5F1, which encodes octamer-binding transcription factor-4
   (Oct-4). The 579 bp cloned coding sequence of possum PDU5F1 (tvPOU5F1)
   shaves 74, 78, and 79\% identify with murine Pou5f1, human POU5F1, and
   bovine bPOU5F1, respectively, at the protein level. The mRNA for
   tvPOU5F1 was detected by in situ hybridization in oogonia and in oocytes
   of growing follicles, but not in early meiotic oocytes. In a
   gastrulation-stage conceptus, high tvPOU5F1 expression was found in the
   embryonic ectoderm, with low or undetectable expression in other cell
   types. These results are comparable with those of murine and bovine
   expression studies, and suggest that the putative role of POU5F1 in
   totipotent and pluripotent cells is conserved among mammals. (C) 2001

Abstract = {Acrotriche serrulata exhibits a complex and uncommon form of flowering.
   It starts with a male-phase flower that shows secondary pollen
   presentation on the perianth and follows with a female phase after the
   corolla is removed or abscissed. We examined the potential for insects,
   lizards, and mammals to act as pollinators. Observations and experiments
   on breeding system, phenology, floral scent, flower visitors, and lizard
   feeding were undertaken in southern Australia. Acrotriche serrulata sets
   little fruit by autonomous selfing but readily sets fruit after
   facilitated geitonogamy and xenogamy. Flower anthesis is diurnal and
   nocturnal. The nectar profile includes acetaldehyde, ethanol, and ethyl
   acetate. The nocturnal mammals Trichosurus vulpecula and the introduced
   Rattus rattus were the only visitors observed to actively forage on the
   flowers. In contrast, the skinks Egernia whitii, Niveoscincus ocellatus,
   and Niveoscincus metallicus routinely passed flowers full of nectar and
   foraged only on those presented during feeding observations. Insects
   visited the flowers but did not behave as pollinators. Acrotriche
   serrulata is likely to be pollinated by nocturnal mammals attracted to
   its flowers by scent. Effective pollinators appear to be rare over some
   of its range. This may have implications for the long-term reproductive
   success and conservation of A. serrulata.},

Abstract = {The ovarian distribution of the steroidogenic enzyme
   3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta(5-->4) isomerase (3beta-HSD)
   was investigated by immunocytochemistry in two marsupial species
   throughout the reproductive cycle, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody
   raised against human placental 3beta-HSD. In the polyoestrous and
   polyovular South American opossum Monodelphis domestica, immunostaining
   was positive for 3beta-HSD in the adrenal cortex, the ovarian
   interstitial tissue, the corpus luteum and the granulosa cells of antral
   and atretic follicles. The theca interna was weakly positive for
   3beta-HSD, but only in late preantral to early antral stages of
   follicular development. The adrenal medulla and smaller preantral
   follicles were completely negative for 3beta-HSD. In contrast, in the
   polyoestrous and monovular Australian brushtail possum Trichosurus
   vulpecula, immunostaining showed a strong positive reaction for
   3beta-HSD in the theca, whereas the granulosa layer remained
   predominantly negative for 3beta-HSD except in the largest follicles.
   The atretic follicles were completely negative for 3beta-HSD. The
   ovaries of pregnant animals contained grossly enlarged, persistent,
   antral follicles, which reacted positively for 3beta-HSD. The function
   of these follicles in T vulpecula and the 3beta-HSD-positive atretic
   follicles in M. domestica has not been determined. The differences
   between the two marsupials represent species variations. The situation
   in M. domestica does not represent a marsupial-eutherian dichotomy as
   previously conjectured.},

Title = {Development of a porcine follicle-stimulating hormone and porcine

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2002},

Pages = {453-460},
Abstract = {Monovulatory brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were stimulated
   with exogenous hormones during seasonal anoestrus to overcome ovarian
   insensitivity and induce ovulation. Seasonal ovarian insensitivity to
   pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) was overcome by a new porcine
   follicle-stimulating hormone/porcine luteinizing hormone (pFSH/pLH)
   protocol. This protocol was refined because the original treatment
   produced oocytes with abnormal morphology. Possums (n = 12 per group)
   received eight injections of pFSH of 1.5, 3.0 or 6.0 mg per injection
   (at 12-h intervals for 4 consecutive days). Ovulation was induced 12 h
   after the final pFSH injection with a 4-mg injection of pLH. Control
   animals were treated with the established protocol of a single injection
   of 15 IU of PMSG, followed 48 h later with an injection of 4 mg of pLH.
   All females responded to pFSH/pLH treatment, although optimal
   stimulation occurred in those receiving 8 x 3 mg pFSH, with 13-14
   ovulations and recovery of 11-12 oocytes per female (8 x 1.5 mg pFSH: 13
   ovulations, 8-9 oocytes; 8 x 6 mg pFSH: 7-8 ovulations, 4-5 oocytes). In
   contrast, only seven of 12 females responded to PMSG/pLH and, of those
   responding, only 2-3 ovulations occurred and only 1-2 oocytes per female
   were recovered. However, around 80\% of oocytes recovered after PMSG/pLH
   treatment had undergone nuclear maturation (metaphase II/1st polar body)
   compared with around 60\% of oocytes from pFSH/pLH-treated animals. In
   possums killed from 27 to 39 h after pLH treatment, ovulation onset was
   first observed from 30 h and by 31.5 h, all animals had completed
   ovulation. Laparoscopic artificial insemination (LAI) was performed on
   pFSH/pLH-treated animals to determine whether the oocytes produced were
   capable of fertilization. Uterine LAI performed 27.5-28.5 h after pLH
   treatment yielded 11/26 fertilized oocytes (up to 4-cell stage), whereas
   vaginal LAI performed 13-14 h after pLH treatment yielded 21/53
   fertilized oocytes. A proportion of oocytes generated from the refined
   pFSH/pLH protocol are thus properly mature and capable of fertilization.
   Further refinement of the protocol is now needed to improve the yield of
   fully matured oocytes.},

   between four marsupial species, Sminthopsis crassicaudata, Potorous
   tridactylus, Trichosurus vulpecula and Macropus eugenii, which are from
   different families in two orders, were investigated and presented in the
   form of comparative chromosome maps. These show that only a limited
   number of chromosomal rearrangements have occurred during their
   evolution. A karyotype phylogeny of the four marsupials was derived from
   these maps. A comparison between published gene location and the
   comparative chromosome maps for these species is presented and
   inconsistencies with previous gene mapping data indicated.},

Abstract = {Whereas sexual dimorphism in body mass is common in many vertebrates,
   the developmental mechanisms leading to diverging growth patterns
   between the sexes are poorly understood in mammals. In the present
   study, I investigate seasonal and lifetime differences in sex-specific
   mass in a marsupial, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula). From the age of 2 years, males were heavier than females,
   but significant dimorphism was evident only at the age of 4 years.
   Annual mass gain was greater in males than in females from 2 to 4 years
   of age. The body mass of both sexes fluctuated throughout the year,
   although patterns differed: females lost mass during lactation in
   winter, whereas males lost mass during the breeding season in later
   summer and autumn. The mass of a juvenile predicted its mass as an adult
   for males, but not females. Male-biased sexual dimorphism in mass of
   possums appears to arise through a combination of a greater rate and
   duration of mass gain in young males, and the diversion of somatic
   reserves away from growth and into reproduction in females.},

Abstract = {Habitat degradation contributes to species decline, and habitat quality
   is an important factor influencing reintroduction success globally.
   Habitat quality can include a range of physical resources such as nest
   sites and food resources but also anything that can restrict the use of
   these resources such as predation risk or competition. In arid
   Australia, introduced predators are thought to be the primary cause of
   mammal extinction and reintroduction failure although habitat clearance
   and alteration are also major causes of population decline. Common
   brushtail possums are one arid Australian marsupial close to regional
   extinction. To understand whether habitat quality was limiting their
   recovery, we reintroduced 148 possums into an area where introduced red
   foxes were controlled but historic overgrazing had degraded the habitat.
   We measured both direct (hollow availability, midstorey cover and
   high-quality plant foods) and indirect (survival, condition,
   reproduction, movement) measures of habitat quality. Sixty-seven
   released possums and 26 post-release recruits were radiocollared for up
   to 2 years after release. Post-release survival of radiocollared possums
   was high after 12 months (0.70), and there were no deaths from
   starvation. Predation by feral cats was the most common cause of
   mortality, and the open, degraded habitat may have exacerbated predation
   risk. Continuous breeding, good body condition and comparative home
   ranges with other sites suggested that food resources were not limiting.
   Possums used natural tree hollows inEucalyptusspp. with no use of
   artificial nest boxes. Results suggest that historically degraded
   habitat was not a barrier to short-term reintroduction success when
   foxes were controlled and natural tree hollows were plentiful. However,
   demographic data on hollow-bearing tree species suggest a possible
   future decline in availability of hollows. These factors, combined with
   the unknown effects of drought, and synergistic effects of predation and
   poor quality habitat, suggest long-term reintroduction success may
   require improved habitat and cat control.},

Abstract = {Fertility control is currently under development for the control of
   brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), one of New Zealand's most
   serious vertebrate pests. Despite intensive research into various
   methods for achieving infertility, including immunocontraception and
   disrupting endocrine control of reproduction, researchers know little
   about the potential effects of these methods on the behavior of wild
   possums. We assessed the effects of surgically imposed sterility, either
   to block fertilization (tubal ligation) or to disrupt endocrine control
   of fertility (gonadectomy), by using radiotelemetry on the movement
   patterns and site fidelity of wild brushtail possums. In addition, we
   assessed the effect of gonadectomy on the transmission rate of a
   commonly occurring, directly transmitted pathogen in possums, Leptospira
   interrogans serovar balcanica (hereafter L. balcanica), to determine the
   effect of any behavioral changes on possum contact rates. Both tubal
   ligation and gonadectomy of females did not appear to have any
   appreciable effect on behavior, with sterilized females having space-use
   patterns and fidelity to seasonal breeding ranges similar to those of
   fertile females. However, gonadectomy of male possums resulted in a
   significant reduction of 42\% and 47\% in the 95\% and 70\% isopleth
   seasonal breeding ranges, respectively. Furthermore, the transmission
   rate of L. balcanica in gonadectomized male and female possums was
   reduced by 88\% and 63\%, respectively, compared with that in fertile
   male and female possums. Overall, these results suggest that fertility
   control, either by blocking fertilization (e.g., immunocontraception) or
   by disrupting endocrine control of reproduction (e.g.,
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone vaccines), is unlikely to have an impact
   on social organization and behavior of brushtail possums in ways that
   may compromise the efficacy of fertility control for reducing population
   density. However, the reduction in the transmission rate of L. balcanica
   indicates that fertility control that interferes with endocrine control
   of reproduction is likely to reduce the contact rate between possums.
   This could have implications for the control of other wildlife diseases
   requiring direct contact for transmission.},

   (Trichosurus vulpecula)},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {489-492},
Abstract = {Newborn marsupials do not have a thyroid gland at birth. The gland
   develops while the young marsupial is in the mother's pouch. The young
   brushtail possum initiates secretion of thyroid hormones from its own
   thyroid at about Day 65 post partum. However, during the first three
   weeks of pouch life thyroxine is passed from the mother to the young via
   the milk. To determine if this maternal thyroxine can effect organ
   development in the young possum before it initiates secretion of
   thyroxine from its own thyroid, the ontogeny of thyroid hormone
   receptors was determined in nuclear extracts of lung, liver and kidney
   by radioreceptor assay, using I-125-labelled tri-iodothyronine as
   ligand. Receptor density was calculated for tissues removed from young
   possums at Days 25 (n = 5), 50 (n = 4), 100 (n = 3) and 150 (n = 4) and
   from adults (n = 5). Receptors were found in possums of all age groups,
   including the small 25-day pouch young. Significant differences were not
   found in the receptor density between different tissues or at various
   ages. The association constant K-a (4.0+/-2.6 L nmol(-1) for lung) was
   similar in different tissues and at the various ages examined. The
   passage of thyroid hormones from the mother to the developing marsupial
   via the milk may have a role in the slow development of organ systems
   early in pouch life by acting on thyroid receptors in the pouch young.
   However, the functional maturation of the thyroid gland of the young
   possum, not an increase in receptors, appears to coincide with the rapid
   increase in the rate of growth and development which occurs in later
   pouch life.},

Abstract = {Vectored immunocontraception is a novel technology and simple models are
   described to help predict whether, and how, ii might work. That is,
   given that an effective immunocontraceptive agent can be produced, and
   given that it can be inserted into a microparasitic or macroparasitic
   infective vector, would the vector persist and reach a high prevalence
   in the host and, if so, would it sterilize a sufficient proportion of
   the host breeding population to significantly reduce its density? Both
   conditions are necessary for success.
   The first question is an epidemiological one, relating solely to
   disseminating systems and differing according to whether the vector
   itself is newly introduced or pre-existing. If it is newly introduced,
   the assumption is that it is present in some other geographical areas
   occupied by the same target species, or is found in closely-related
   species. If the vector already exists in the population, the issue is
   one of competition between the engineered and wild-type vectors.
   The second question is an ecological one, common to both
   non-disseminating and disseminating systems. Whatever level of
   sterilization the immunocontraception provides must translate into a
   significant reduction in population density, having regard to the nature
   and extent of compensatory, density-dependence mechanisms in the
   population.
   These two questions, together with other more minor issues, are
   addressed in turn with particular reference to models for
   immunocontraception of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New
   Zealand.},

Abstract = {Options for the biological control of brushtail possums (Trichosurus
   vulpecula) are being evaluated in the hope of finding a cost-effective,
   long-term solution to the problem of reducing numbers of possums as
   hosts of bovine tuberculosis and as threats to conservation values.
   Methods of inhibiting possum reproduction by affecting sex steroid
   levers are among the options. However, this may result in behavioural
   changes. In some species, a loss of status by dominant animals allows
   subordinates to breed more successfully. This paper describes how social
   hierarchies in captive groups of possums are affected by vaccination of
   dominant females against gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to block
   all centrally controlled steroid hormone release. Ten groups consisting
   of two females and one male were established in pens, and the dominance
   status of each animal was measured by recording the outcome of social
   interactions during monthly observations. The dominant female in each
   pen was vaccinated against GnRH with a series of three immunisations.
   Social hierarchies remained unchanged over the 2-4 months after
   vaccination of the dominant females. We therefore conclude that methods
   of biological control that disrupt sex steroid production could be
   considered for possum control once these findings are confirmed by
   similar observations on wild possums.},

Abstract = {AIM: To compare the humoral immune responses of female possums to
   ovalbumin (OVA) and cholera toxin (CT) administered using different
   routes and dosage regimes.
   METHODS: Three groups of mature female possums were immunised
   intragastrically (n=15) or surgically (intraileal, n=4; Peyer's patches,
   n=4). Levels of antibodies to OVA and CT in serum, ilea, vaginal,
   oviduct and uterine secretions were measured by indirect enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All manipulations were conducted under
   general anaesthesia.
   RESULTS: Antibodies to CT increased significantly in serum (p<0.001) and
   in lateral vaginal secretions (p<0.05) after intragastric immunisation
   using 250-1000 mug CT. Simultaneous intragastric administration of CT
   with 3 mg OVA did not significantly increase antibody levels to OVA.
   When OVA (3 mg) and CT (250 mug) were injected into the ileum, followed
   by intragastric administration 4 weeks later, antibody Levels to CT were
   significantly (p<0.05) increased in serum, uterine and medial vagina
   secretions, and antibody levels to OVA were significantly (p<0.05)
   increased in serum and medial vaginal secretions. When OVA (3 mg) with
   Incomplete Freund's adjuvant was injected directly into Peyer's patches,
   followed by peritonea administration 4 weeks later, antibody levels in
   serum, ilea and reproductive-tract secretions were generally higher than
   those that resulted from the other immunisation treatments.
   CONCLUSIONS: Administration of OVA induced an antibody response in serum
   and in reproductive and alimentary tract secretions when administered
   with CT directly into the ileum, or when injected into Peyer's patches
   and peritoneum. CT was a potent enteric immunogen.},

Abstract = {In this study of brushtail possums, proteins present in epididymal fluid
   and not present in blood plasma and those that become associated with
   spermatozoa as they pass along the tract were investigated. At least 19
   proteins were present in epididymal fluid in the various regions of the
   tract that were not detected in serum. Some of these may be present on
   the sperm plasmalemma. Six proteins were extracted from caput
   spermatozoa (M-r 117 000, 103 000, 87 500, 85 000, 62 000 and 33 000)
   that did not appear in the caudal sperm extracts. Eight proteins (M-r 50
   000, 49 000, 32 000, 27 000, 26 500, 25 000, 24 500 and 18 000) were
   localized to caudal sperm extracts. These findings suggest that some
   sperm proteins are lost or modified, whereas others are added to the
   sperm plasma membrane during epididymal transit. In vitro incorporation
   of {[}S-35]methionine by the epididymal tissue showed that the distal
   caput and corpus are the most active regions in the synthesis and
   secretion of proteins. Four caudal epididymal proteins (M-r 72 000, 31
   000, 26 500 and 21 000) were partially sequenced. Those of M-r 31 000
   and 26 500 had the same N-terminal amino acid sequence suggesting
   post-translational modification of the same protein; they showed
   homology to a retinoic acid-binding protein. The protein of M-r 72 000
   was found to be homologous to a-fetoprotein, whereas the protein of M-r
   21 000 showed no significant homology to any protein in the database.
   These results show that the lumen of the epididymis has many proteins
   that are not present in the blood, some of which appear to become
   associated with spermatozoa during epididymal transit.},

Abstract = {A protocol was developed for pellet-freezing spermatozoa of the tammar
   wallaby and the brushtail possum. Semen was collected by
   electro-ejaculation and wallaby spermatozoa were washed by `swim-up'
   into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), whereas possum spermatozoa were
   not washed. Wallaby spermatozoa were screened for toxicity in diluents
   containing a range of cryoprotectants (0-10\%): dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO), ethylene glycol, glycerol and propanediol. Possum spermatozoa
   were tolerant of diluents containing 17.5\% glycerol. Wallaby and possum
   spermatozoa were diluted 1:1 with the most promising cryoprotective
   diluents (final concentrations in PBS: possum, 17.5\% glycerol; wallaby,
   7.5\% glycerol+10\% DMSO) and, after 5 min equilibration at room
   temperature, were pellet-frozen. Pellets were thawed (35 degrees C) and
   wallaby spermatozoa were washed by centrifugation (200g for 5 min) and
   resuspended in PBS to minimize cryoprotectant toxicity. A high
   proportion of possum spermatozoa was recovered after freezing (67.5\%),
   having good progressive motility (3.6 on a 0-5 scale). The progressive
   motility of frozen-thawed wallaby spermatozoa was also high (3.0), but
   only 10\% of motile spermatozoa were recovered. The pellet-freezing
   method in conjunction with the post-thaw washing procedure (wallaby) may
   produce a viable population of cryopreserved marsupial spermatozoa
   suitable for use in assisted-breeding techniques such as in vitro
   fertilization and artificial insemination.},

Abstract = {The production of young by three groups of eight possums, housed in a
   natural, a short-day (10 h light:14 h dark) and a long-day (14 h
   light:10 h dark) photoperiod was monitored for 24 months to determine
   the role of photoperiod on the occurrence and duration of the breeding
   season. Possums were housed in each of the three light regimens on 22
   November. The possum has a gestation duration of 17.5 days. Removal of
   the newborn young leads to ovulation approximately 9 days later and
   birth 26 days later. Repeated removal of pouch young was used to
   determine the duration of the breeding season. Possums in a natural
   photoperiod showed two breeding seasons for the 2 year observation, from
   March to October of each year. Over the same 2 year period, there were
   three breeding periods in possums in short-day and long-day photoperiod.
   A comparison of the timing of the first breeding season showed that
   short-day photoperiod brought the breeding season forward by 2 months
   and long-day photoperiod delayed it by 2.5 months. The total number of
   months in which births occurred was the same for natural and short-day
   photoperiod (16 out of 24 months) and less for long-day photoperiod (11
   months). Fertility in the three groups was also examined. Within each
   group, there was no change in fertility with consecutive seasons.
   However, fertility, whether expressed as births per possum per month for
   each breeding period or births per possum for the total observation
   period, was higher (P < 0.05) in possums in natural photoperiod (total
   of 9.0 +/- 1.2 births per possum) than in short-day (6.5 +/- 1.9 births
   per possum) or long-day (3.8 +/- 1.2 births per possum) photoperiod. It
   was concluded that photoperiod is important in the timing of breeding
   season, in the fertility of breeding possums and, possibly, in the
   duration of breeding seasons, but that it does not determine the
   occurrence of the breeding season.},

Abstract = {Prolactin (Prl) has been implicated in reproduction in many mammalian
   species and is illustrated by the distinctive patterns of secretion
   during the breeding season, the oestrous cycle and lactation. The recent
   development of a homologous RIA for measuring the circulating Prl
   concentrations in brushtail possums has facilitated the reliable
   measurement of Prl in plasma during different physiological states in
   this species for the first time. Determination of Prl concentrations
   during lactation involved the collection of weekly blood samples from
   eight female possums from the time of parturition through either one or
   two consecutive lactational cycles. Prl was at baseline levels during
   early lactation (weeks 0-14 postpartum), and then increased markedly to
   maximum concentrations at weeks 19-21 before returning to nadir levels
   at a time coincident with the weaning of pouch young (weeks 2327). The
   profile of Prl secretion over the oestrous cycle and in particular at
   the time of the preovulatory LH surge was obtained front 14 possums
   during the reproductive cycle, in which preovulatory follicle
   development and ovulation were monitored by laparoscopy. There was no
   distinct daily pattern of Prl secretion during the oestrous cycle;
   however, in 3/4 possums in which a typical preovulatory LH surge was
   measured, a biphasic preovulatory Prl surge was also observed. The
   preovulatory Prl surge commenced 2-6 h prior to, and had returned to
   baseline close to the onset of, the preovulatory LH surge, and a second
   surge of Prl occurred concomitantly with the delayed preovulatory FSH
   surge. Seasonality of Prl levels was established from weekly blood
   samples collected from six barren female possums, and concentrations of
   Prl were lower during the breeding season compared to the non-breeding
   season. Additionally, a circadian pattern of Prl secretion was evident
   in both female and male possums, with Prl levels higher in the morning
   compared to the afternoon. In conclusion, interpretation of endogenous
   secretory patterns suggests that Prl may be important during late
   lactation and at impending ovulation, but the involvement of the
   circannual rhythm of Prl in the regulation of seasonality in the
   brushtail possum remains to be determined.},

Abstract = {Maturation of the fetal pituitary and adrenal glands allows the
   secretion of cortisol, which in turn leads to an increase in
   prostaglandin and mesotocin production. The production of prostaglandin
   and mesotocin results in an increase in uterine contractions and
   initiates birth in marsupials. The major metabolite of PGF(2alpha),
   13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F-2alpha (PGFM), has been found in
   the plasma of the possum at the time of birth and administration of
   PGF(2alpha) to female possums induced the adoption of the birth
   position. Evidence that mesotocin is an integral hormone of birth in the
   tammar wallaby indicates that both PGF(2alpha) and mesotocin or oxytocin
   are required for marsupial birth. The presence of PGF(2alpha) receptors
   in the uterus and corpus luteum of the possum, and the in vitro uterine
   responsiveness to PGF(2alpha) or oxytocin, were examined. PGF(2alpha)
   receptors were not observed in possum uteri and the inability of
   PGF(2alpha) to cause contractions indicates that PGF(2alpha) is not
   involved directly in contraction of the uterus at parturition. The
   presence of oxytocin and mesotocin receptors in the uterus of possoms
   and the ability of oxytocin to induce uterine contraction in vitro
   supports the view that mesotocin is required for expulsion of the young
   from the uterus. Low numbers of PGF(2alpha) receptors were found in the
   possum corpus luteum at birth, indicating an involvement of PGF(2alpha)
   in regression of the corpus luteum.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {One of several functions described for the Fc receptor is regulation of
   IgG isotype transport into milk. The first marsupial homologues of the
   Fc receptor heavy and light chains, FcRn and beta -2 microglobulin, from
   the brushtail possum have been cloned and characterised. The level of
   FcRn mRNA in the possum mammary gland was highest at the start of
   lactation, and decreased slowly thereafter. Expression of FcRn mRNA did
   not increase during the switch phase when the concentration of IgG in
   milk is highest. In contrast, the level of beta -2 microglobulin mRNA in
   the mammary gland increased during the switch phase when milk IgG
   concentration also increases. This correlation between beta -2
   microglobulin mRNA expression in the mammary gland with the time of
   active IgG-transfer into milk was also observed in the bovine and murine
   mammary gland. This suggests that expression of the Fc receptor in the
   mammary gland is controlled by the expression of beta -2 microglobulin
   and that its expression is upregulated during the period of highest
   IgG-transfer into milk. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights

Abstract = {Marsupials and eutherians display vastly different reproductive
   strategies. Marsupials are characterised by the production of altricial
   neonates with little functional capacity. An investigation of the
   ontogenic expression of phase I (mixed function oxidase) and phase II
   (glutathione transferase) enzyme systems in the marsupial, the brushtail
   possum was undertaken. Enzyme expression in the youngest age group
   studied (60 days old) was between 5\% and 10\% of the adult level. A
   gradual increase in expression was then observed until a significant
   3-fold increase to adult levels of expression of cytochrome P450,
   cytochrome b(5) and glutathione transferase content and ECOD and AE
   activity was observed in brushtail possum young between the ages of 150
   +/- 15 and 180 +/- 15 days. The expression of EROD activity reached
   adult levels by the age of 150 +/- days, while the expression of NADPH
   cytochrome c reductase activity was delayed and adult levels had not yet
   been achieved by the oldest group studied (>200 days). The ontogenic
   expression of detoxication enzymes was significantly delayed in the
   marsupial in comparison to eutherians. Adult levels were achieved during
   the weaning period, suggesting that dietary xenobiotics act as a
   regulatory mechanism in the developmental expression of these enzymes in
   the brushtail possum. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {The common method for synchronizing oestrus in brushtail possums is by
   removal of their pouch young (RPY). However, there is little information
   on the ovarian response to this treatment, the timing and incidence of
   ovulation is poorly defined, and methods of identifying oestrus are
   unreliable. In this study, the development of preovulatory follicles,
   ovulation and reproductive tract changes following RPY were monitored by
   repeated laparoscopic observation. A total of 120 adult female possums
   underwent laparoscopy at intervals of 1-4 days over the period from 0 to
   21 days after RPY. Tissue was collected from a further 30 animals for
   correlative histology of ovarian structures, and to quantify changes in
   reproductive tract organs. Only 80 of 120 animals ovulated, and the time
   of ovulation ranged from 7 to 18 days following RPY. In most animals,
   enlargement of vaginal cul-de-sac and uterine tissue occurred within 10
   days. Correlative histology supported the macroscopic classification of
   ovarian structures, and healthy and atretic follicles could be
   identified by laparoscopy. Vaginal smears and plasma progesterone
   concentrations verified the occurrence of ovulation as observed by
   laparoscopy. A `presumptive' preovulatory follicle, first identifiable
   approximately 5 days before ovulation, was recorded in all animals that
   ovulated and in none that failed to ovulate. Changes to its surface
   morphology indicated impending ovulation. This study has enabled the day
   of ovulation to be identified accurately for the first time in this
   species. It has also shown that there is wide variation in follicle
   development, Lack of synchrony in the time of ovulation in the brushtail
   possum, and that some animals fail to ovulate following RPY.},

Abstract = {This study examined the potential of a recombinant marsupial zona
   pellucida 3 protein as a contraceptive vaccine for the Eastern Grey
   kangaroo, a marsupial that is locally overabundant in several regions of
   eastern Australia. First, a pilot study using porcine zona pellucidae
   (PZP) demonstrated that ZP proteins, primarily the ZP3 component of PZP,
   are highly immunogenic in the grey kangaroo and produce a long-lasting
   humoral response to a single immunisation, as found in other marsupials.
   Immunisation with 300 jig of a non-glycosylated recombinant brushtail
   possum ZP3 (recBP-ZP3) protein in complete Freund's adjuvant produced a
   similar, significant and sustained antibody response, and none of the
   immunised kangaroos (n = 7) produced offspring during the following
   breeding season compared with four out of the six control animals. An
   epitope analysis of the B-cell response to recBP-ZP3 using a brushtail
   possum ZP3 identified numerous B-cell epitope regions clustered around
   the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Two regions of interest
   for further fertility vaccine development based on their immunogenicity
   and fertility trials and functional studies in other species were found
   to be immunogenic. These results suggest that immunocontraception based
   on targeting the ZP3 protein within the zona pellucida may be an
   effective strategy for fertility reduction in Eastern Grey kangaroos.

Title = {Assessing the host disease status of wildlife and the implications for
   disease control:: <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> infection in feral ferrets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {708-719},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Estimating the basic reproductive rate (R-0) of disease and/or the
   related threshold population density (K-T) for disease establishment is
   fundamental to determining the host status of wildlife for disease, and
   thus the effective management of pathogens in free-ranging wildlife. The
   strength of inference of host status is largely dependent on the
   precision with which either R-0 or K-T is estimated, yet only a small
   proportion of studies of disease in wildlife have estimated the
   precision of these parameters.
   2. We used a combination of observations, field experiments and
   modelling to estimate the basic reproductive rate of Mycobacterium bovis
   infection in ferrets Mustela furo in New Zealand. Estimates of R-0
   ranged from 0.18 at the lowest standardized annual density (0.5 ferrets
   km(-2)) recorded, to 1.2 at the highest standardized annual density (3.4
   ferrets km(-2)) recorded. The estimates of R-0 were moderately
   imprecise, with a coefficient of variation of 37\%.
   3. The estimated threshold standardized annual density (K-T) for disease
   establishment was 2.9 ferrets km(-2) (95\% confidence interval 1.7-10.6
   ferrets km(-2)); however, only in limited geographical areas of New
   Zealand do ferret population densities exceed this. In these areas,
   ferrets would be considered maintenance hosts (R-0 > 1) for the disease,
   and active management (e.g. density reduction or vaccination) of ferrets
   would be required to eradicate M. bovis from ferret populations, in
   addition to the elimination of sources of interspecific transmission,
   notably brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results have considerable
   implications for the management of M. bovis in ferret populations in New
   Zealand and elsewhere in the world. In areas of high ferret density,
   ferrets are probably a maintenance host of bovine tuberculosis, so
   active management is required to reduce disease incidence. More widely,
   the results demonstrate clearly how modelling and field observations may
   be combined to better inform managers of a wildlife disease.},

Title = {UNEXPECTED OOCYTE GROWTH AFTER FOLLICULAR ANTRUM FORMATION IN 4

Journal = {JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION AND FERTILITY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {During examination of maturing preovulatory marsupial oocytes we noted
   that oocyte diameters were invariably about 50\% greater than the
   figures reported in earlier histological studies. As all previous
   investigations were limited to small follicles (at most 25\% the size of
   the ovulating follicle), the present study was initiated to examine
   oocyte growth during the whole period of follicular development. Oocyte
   and follicle diameters were measured for three Australian (Trichosurus
   vulpecula, Macropus eugenii and Bettongia penicillata - fresh nonfixed
   material) and one American marsupial species (Monodelphis domestica -
   histological sections) in which multiple follicle development had been
   induced by exogenous gonadotrophin treatment. In all species oocytes
   were obtained from follicles ranging from pre-antral to immediately
   pre-ovulatory (maximum follicle sizes obtained were: T. vulpecula, 4.5
   mm; M. eugenii, 4-3 mm; B. penicillata, 2.5 mm; M. domestica, 0.7 mm).
   In two of the species (T. vulpecula and B. penicillata) ovulated oocytes
   were also examined.
   In T. vulpecula and M. eugenii oocytes were found to achieve much
   greater diameters than previously reported from histological studies of
   small follicles (< 0.8 mm) and similar patterns of growth were found in
   the other two species. In the four species oocytes reached diameters
   about two to three times that found for eutherian mammals. It was
   concluded that the marsupial oocyte continued to grow after formation of
   the follicular antrum and that, although the rate of oocyte growth
   slowed in larger follicles, it continued into the period immediately
   before ovulation. In B. penicillata the largest oocytes were obtained
   after ovulation. The increases in diameter corresponded to a three to
   four times increase in the volume of oocytes from follicular antrum
   formation to ovulation.
   These data, and our earlier observations on cortical granule formation,
   suggest that the marsupial oocyte operates on a very different
   developmental timetable from the eutherian oocyte. The most likely basis
   of the observed late growth is the accumulation of `yolk'.},

Abstract = {Fertilization has been achieved in superovulated brushtail possums and
   tammar wallabies after laparoscopic intrauterine artificial
   insemination. Various superovulation protocols and insemination times
   were examined but a maximum of 2-5 eggs including 1-2 embryos per possum
   were recovered. The female possums were superovulated by treatment with
   15 iu pregnant mares' serum gonadotrophin and then either GnRH (4 x 50
   mu g, at intervals of 90 min) or 4 mg LH, 3 days later. Inseminations
   were performed within 6 h before or 4-10 h after (pregnant mares'
   serum,gonadotrophin-GnRH group only) the expected onset of ovulation
   using epididymal spermatozoa. Superovulation in wallabies was achieved
   by treatment with FSH (8 x 6 mg, at intervals of 12 h for 4 days)
   followed by 4 mg LH on day 5. Inseminations were performed 4-6 h before
   the expected onset of ovulation using ejaculated spermatozoa, which
   resulted in the recovery of 7-8 eggs including 3-4 embryos per female.
   All embryos recovered were from possums and wallabies examined 1-2 days
   after insemination and included fertilized eggs, two-cell and four-cell
   embryos. Motile spermatozoa were recovered from the oviducts and uteri
   but only immotile spermatozoa were found in the vaginal complex. Five to
   thirty per cent of spermatozoa recovered from the oviducts of possums
   examined 2-6 h after insemination had thumbtack morphology, which is
   thought to be correlated with capacitation. Although embryo yields per
   female were low, this study has established that intrauterine artificial
   insemination after superovulation is a feasible assisted breeding
   strategy for marsupials with implications for species conservation and
   population control.},

Abstract = {IGFs are known to be key regulators of ovarian follicular growth in
   eutherian mammals, but little is known regarding their role in
   marsupials. To better understand the potential role of IGFs in the
   regulation of follicular growth in marsupials, expression of mRNAs
   encoding IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), IGFBP4 and
   IGFBP5 was localized by in situ hybridization in developing ovarian
   follicles of the brushtail possum. In addition, the effects of IGF1 and
   IGF2 on granulosa cell function were tested in vitro. Both granulosa and
   theca cells synthesize IGF mRNAs, with the theca expressing IGF1 mRNA
   and granulosa cell expressing IGF2 mRNA. Oocytes and granulosa cells
   express IGF1R. Granulosa and theca cells expressed IGFBP mRNAs, although
   the pattern of expression differed between the BPs. IGFBP5 mRNA was
   differentially expressed as the follicles developed with granulosa cells
   of antral follicles no longer expressing IGFBP5 mRNA, suggesting an
   increased IGF bioavailability in the antral follicle. The IGFBP
   protease, PAPPA mRNA, was also expressed in granulosa cells of growing
   follicles. Both IGF1 and IGF2 stimulated thymidine incorporation but had
   no effect on progesterone production. Thus, IGF may be an important
   regulator of ovarian follicular development in marsupials as has been
   shown in eutherian mammals. Reproduction ( 2010) 140 295-303},

Abstract = {The composition of milk from free-ranging koalas was examined as part of
   a study of the energetics of reproduction in the koala, an arboreal
   folivorous marsupial that displays a number of energetically
   conservative characteristics often associated with arboreality and
   folivory. Koala milk composition showed a number of deviations from the
   general marsupial pattern that suggest koalas have adopted a lactational
   strategy different from that of most other marsupials previously
   studied. Milk solids decreased at the time of exit of the young from the
   pouch, in contrast with the solids content of the milk of most
   marsupials, which rises at that time. Lipids provided that major source
   of milk energy even in early to midlactation and did not rise at pouch
   exit, unlike lipid levels in other marsupials, which are low in early to
   midlactation and rise sharply at pouch exit to high levels in late
   lactation. The carbohydrates of late-lactation koala milk contained
   mainly lactose and some oligosaccharides, but little or none of the
   monosaccharide found in the milk of many other marsupials. Koalas share
   most of these features with the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula) and common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus), the
   only two other marsupial arboreal folivores in which milk composition
   has been studied. This suggests that the koala's pattern of changes in
   milk composition may be common to marsupial arboreal folivores and may
   be associated with energetic limitations imposed directly by their
   folivorous diet or indirectly via selection for their long period of
   lactation and slow weaning. However, koalas' milk was more concentrated
   that that of the other two marsupial folivores, the importance of which,
   to the lactational strategy of the koala, can be resolved only by
   further study of milk production.},

Abstract = {A new superovulation regimen for the monovulatory brushtail possum
   (Trichosurvus vulpecula) has been devised. It reduces the number of
   hormone treatments required and elicits a better rate of ovulation than
   the established pregnant mares' serum gonadotrophin (PMSG)-GnRH method.
   Ovarian stimulation was achieved by a single intramuscular injection of
   15 iu PMSG. This treatment resulted in the recruitment and development
   of a large number (9-12) of Graafian follicles on the ovaries. Induction
   of ovulation was achieved by a single intramuscular injection of 2-10 mg
   pig LH or multiple intramuscular injections of GnRH, (4 x 50 mu g, 90
   min apart) given 72 h after PMSG treatment. Superovulation occurred in
   all animals (n = 48) examined 48 h after treatment irrespective of dose
   of LH or type of ovulatory stimulus used. The highest ovulatory success
   (83\%), the maximum number of ovulation sites (9.5 +/- 2.8) and the
   highest number of oocytes recovered (9.0 +/- 2.5) were achieved after
   treatment with PMSG and 4 mg LH. These results were significantly
   greater than the ovulatory success (43\%), numbers of ovulation sites
   (3.9 +/- 1.1) and number of oocytes recovered (2.1 +/- 0.9) after
   PMSG-GnRH treatment (P < 0.05). This simpler and more effective
   superovulation protocol should assist with more effective manipulation
   of possum reproduction in captivity.},

Abstract = {In this study of the unique stability of the marsupial acrosome,
   experiments were carried out on the acrosomes of spermatozoa of the
   tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula) and grey short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica). Light
   microscopy showed that 4\% of opossum and 15\% of possum and wallaby
   spermatozoa lost their acrosomes after freeze-thawing. Electron
   microscopy revealed that freeze-thawing also induced changes in the
   acrosomal matrix of some acrosome intact spermatozoa. In both possum and
   wallaby, freeze-thawing increased the number of spermatozoa with
   vesiculation of the acrosomal matrix. Freeze-thawing disrupted the
   plasma membrane of spermatozoa but the acrosomal membranes remained
   intact.
   Immediately on addition of high concentrations of TX-100 (0.02\% and
   0.04\%) there was significant loss of acrosomes and motility in possum
   and wallaby spermatozoa. Lower concentrations of TX-100
   (less-than-or-equal-to 0.01\%) did not affect motility for up to 30 min
   in all three species, and there was no significant loss of acrosomes.
   Although loss of acrosomes did not occur under mild detergent treatment,
   56\% of wallaby and 70\% of possum spermatozoa had altered acrosomes
   after 30 min in 0.01\% TX-100. Electron microscopy revealed that
   acrosomes were undergoing a vesiculation process similar to that seen
   after freeze-thawing. Often the plasma membrane of detergent-treated
   spermatozoa was disrupted and had formed plasma membrane vesicles.
   However, the acrosomal membranes remained intact despite major changes
   to the acrosomal matrix. The study confirmed the remarkable stability of
   the marsupial acrosome and suggested that this is probably based in the
   acrosomal membranes.},

Abstract = {The role of photoperiod on the initiation of the breeding season of
   brushtail possums was investigated in possums housed in three light
   regimens: a short-day, a natural and a long-day photoperiod. Seven
   possums were housed in a natural photoperiod. Four possums were
   transferred to a short-day photoperiod (10 h light, 14 h dark) and eight
   possums to a long-day photoperiod (14 h light, 10 h dark) on 22
   November, when the daylength was 13.34 h. The first rises in plasma
   progesterone concentrations were observed on 9 January +/- 9 days (n =
   4), 11 March +/- 6 days (n = 7) and 6 May +/- 6 days (n = 8), for
   possums held in short-day, natural or long-day photoperiods
   respectively. Similarly, births were observed on 12 January and 14
   February in the short-day group, from 3 March to 8 May for the natural
   photoperiod group, and from 5 May to 8 August for the long-day group.
   These results suggest that photoperiod is important in the timing of the
   breeding season. However, annual breeding will commence in a
   nonstimulatory long-day photoperiod. Thus a long-day photoperiod does
   not prevent breeding activity.},

Abstract = {By means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
   three stem cell factor (SCF) cDNAs (822-738 bp in size) were amplified
   from brushtail possum ovarian poly (A)(+) RNA. The largest and smallest
   of these cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. Characterization of these
   cDNAs has revealed that possum SCF has approximately 75\% and 66\%
   homology to SCF of eutherian mammals at the nucleotide level and the
   predicted amino acid level respectively. Nucleotide sequencing shows
   that the 738-bp cDNA represents an mRNA splice variant, equivalent to
   that found in eutherian mammals, in which an exon (84 bp) encoding a
   potential proteolytic cleavage site is removed. Comparison of the
   predicted possum SCF amino acid sequence with the predicted SCF amino
   acid sequences from eutherian mammals reveals conservation of all
   cysteine residues and 3 of 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. In
   addition, the hydropathicity profile of the possum SCF protein is
   similar to that of eutherian SCF suggesting that protein conformation is
   conserved. Northern analysis was used to characterize possum SCF gene
   expression in adult ovary and testis. A major transcript of 9 kb was
   observed in both ovarian and testicular tissue. The conservation of the
   SCF gene and its predicted protein, suggests that SCF in the possum has
   similar biological activities to SCF in eutherian mammals.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {1999},

Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that co-culture of brushtail possum
   epididymal spermatozoa with oviduct epithelial cell monolayers prolongs
   sperm survival and results in the re-orientation of the sperm head and
   tail to the T-shape (thumbtack) configuration. Transformation of sperm
   to thumbtack orientation is believed to be associated with marsupial
   sperm capacitation. Here we report that incubation in
   oviduct-conditioned media also significantly prolongs sperm survival and
   results in the transformation of sperm to the thumbtack orientation. The
   major objective of the current study was to examine the proteins present
   in the conditioned media, to determine whether any of these proteins
   specifically bound to sperm and the relationship between these proteins
   and sperm survival and thumbtack orientation. Co-culturing brushtail
   possum sperm with biotin-labeled proteins in conditioned media (CM) from
   ampulla, isthmus and uterine explants demonstrated strong binding of two
   proteins of molecular mass 230 and 61 kD and weak binding of nine
   proteins of molecular mass 200, 180, 120, 140, 55, 52, 48, 34, 30 kD to
   sperm within 30 min. The binding of the 61-kD protein from the
   conditioned media appeared specific as increasing concentrations of
   non-labeled oviduct proteins, but not serum proteins, inhibited the
   binding of labeled proteins. The binding of oviduct and uterine proteins
   in the conditioned media significantly prolonged sperm survival and
   percentage motility and also transformed a large number of sperm to a
   thumbtack orientation. The implication of binding of these proteins is
   discussed in the context of sperm survival and capacitation in this
   species.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {345-353},
Abstract = {The ontogeny of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) gene expression in the
   brushtail possum during formation of the ovary and growth of follicles
   was examined using in situ hybridization. For comparative purposes, the
   expression pattern of AMH was also examined in the developing testis. In
   the female, AMH mRNA was observed in the ovary of 50\% (3/6) of pouch
   young collected around the time of sexual differentiation of the gonad
   (Days 1-5): the signal was predominately localized to the inner-cortical
   and outer-medullary region of the ovary. Thereafter, AMH mRNA was not
   observed in the developing ovary until Days 78-113 of postnatal life
   when follicles first formed at the cortical-medullary boundary. At this
   time, AMH mRNA was observed in the cuboidal granulosa cells of some
   early growing (i.e. transitional) follicles and in the granulosa cells
   of primary follicles. Thereafter, AMH mRNA was present in granulosa
   cells at all subsequent stages of follicular growth (i.e. primary
   through antral), but not in preovulatory follicles. In all cases, once
   follicles had formed, AMH mRNA was limited to the granulosa cells and
   was not observed in the surface epithelium, stromal cells, oocytes,
   theca, corpus luteum, medullary cords, rete or interstitial glands. In
   the possum testis, Sertoli cells strongly expressed AMH around the time
   of sexual differentiation of the gonad, but expression decreased to very
   low levels in adults, suggesting that AMH plays a similar role in
   brushtail possums to that observed in other mammalian species. In
   conclusion, localization of mRNA for AMH exclusively to granulosa cells
   of growing follicles in the brushtail possum is consistent with a
   central role for this hormone in control of granulosa cell function in
   marsupials. In addition, expression of AMH in the developing ovary
   around the time of morphological sexual differentiation raises
   intriguing questions regarding the possible role of AMH at this time.},

Abstract = {The mammalian zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular glycoprotein coat
   that plays vital roles throughout fertilisation and preimplantation
   development. Like that of eutherian mammals the brushtail possum ZP is
   composed of three glycosylated proteins of 137 kDa, 92 kDa and 62 kDa.
   The 62 kDa protein is a ZP3 orthologue based on its nucleotide and
   deduced amino acid sequence. The brushtail possum ZP3 cDNA isolated in
   this study is 1305 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding a 422
   amino acid peptide of 45.7 kDa. Possum ZP3 has a 46\% amino acid
   identity with eutherian ZP3 and shares similar structural
   characteristics including 12 conserved cysteine residues, N-Linked
   glycosylation sites and hydrophobic regions. Like human and rabbit mi an
   altered furin cleavage site upstream of the C-terminal hydrophobic
   domain also occurs in possum ZP3 (S-R-K-R), suggestive of processing by
   a furin-related endoprotease. Expression of brushtail possum ZP3 is
   limited to the ovary. Characterisation of brushtail possum ZP3 will
   enable examination of its functional role in marsupial fertilisation and
   its effectiveness as an immunocontraceptive agent.},

Abstract = {The transfer of animals from the wild into captivity is an important
   strategy for the conservation of species that are under threat of
   extinction. To determine the reproductive capability of animals
   following transfer from the wild, brushtail possums relocated from
   Brisbane, Adelaide, and Armidale into captivity in Brisbane were
   monitored. Seventy five percent of the Brisbane possums (N = 80) gave
   birth during the months from March to May following transfer from the
   suburbs of Brisbane and 75\% of the young born reached weaning. Thirteen
   adult females and four adult male brushtail possums were relocated from
   Adelaide into captivity in Brisbane in June 1994. Four young were born
   in :Brisbane, however none survived to weaning and all the relocated
   possums had died 2 years after their transfer from Adelaide. Seventeen
   adult females and seven adult male possums were transferred from
   Armidale to Brisbane in July 1996. In the first year, 1997, four young
   were born in Brisbane and none survived to weaning. In the second year,
   three young were born and survived to weaning. Two years after their
   transfer, one adult male and three adult females from Armidale and three
   juvenile possums were housed in the Brisbane enclosures. As the
   Brisbane, Adelaide, and Armidale possums received the same photoperiod
   and environmental conditions, some factor must have inhibited breeding
   activity in the Adelaide possums and to a lesser extent in the Armidale
   possums. The ability of the Armidale possums to give birth and wean
   their young after 2 years in Brisbane would suggest that relocated
   possums require up to 2 years in order to adjust sufficiently to their
   new environment to reproduce. However, the failure of the Adelaide
   possums to reproduce successfully after a similar period of time in
   Brisbane suggests that certain environmental differences inhibit the
   ability of different populations of possums to adjust to a new
   environment. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Luteinizing hormone (LH) plays an important role in the reproductive
   cycles of all mammals. There is a large amount of both nucleotide and
   amino acid sequence data available for LH from eutherian mammals, but
   little is known about the primary structure of LH in marsupials. We have
   used consensus PCR primers to generate specific probes for screening
   pituitary cDNA libraries and report the cloning of the cDNAs encoding
   the alpha-subunit of LH (also shared by a number of other glycoprotein
   hormones) and the LH-specific beta-subunit, from the common brushtail
   possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, and the red kangaroo, Macropus rufus.
   Southern blotting experiments indicated that both genes are probably
   present as single copies. Comparison of the deduced marsupial protein
   sequences with homologous sequences from other vertebrates revealed a
   high degree of conservation, especially for the alpha-subunit. These
   sequences represent the first complete primary structures for a
   marsupial glycoprotein hormone to have been elucidated.},

Abstract = {The prostate gland in the brushtail possum grows and regresses
   seasonally. It has similarities to the human prostate and may therefore
   provide a unique model for investigating prostatic hyperplasia. Oxytocin
   has been implicated in the regulation of prostate growth in eutherian
   mammals, and the initial aim of this study was to identify and localize
   the marsupial equivalent, mesotocin, and its receptor in the prostate of
   the brushtail possum. Seasonal changes in prostatic mesotocin
   concentrations and receptor localization were then assessed and related
   to prostate growth. Mesotocin and mesotocin receptor gene transcripts
   with high sequence homology to eutherian oxytocin/oxytocin receptors
   were demonstrated, and mesotocin, neurophysin, and the receptor were all
   localized predominantly in the epithelial cells of the glandular acini.
   Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a single immunoreactive
   receptor protein of similar to60 M-r(-3). Prostatic mesotocin
   concentrations were highest immediately before the increases in prostate
   weight associated with the autumn and spring breeding periods. At this
   time, mesotocin receptors were also present in the prostatic capsule in
   addition to those present in the glandular tissue. Mesotocin
   concentrations proceeded to decrease in association with the regression
   of prostate size toward the end of the breeding periods. No significant
   differences were present in serum testosterone or dihydrotestosterone
   throughout the year. The identification of mesotocin and its receptor in
   the possum prostate and the demonstration of seasonal changes in local
   mesotocin concentrations preceding changes in prostate size suggests
   that mesotocin may play a physiological role in regulating prostate
   growth and regression.},

Abstract = {The marsupial conceptus is enclosed by several egg coats of evolutionary
   significance and unknown composition, of which the shell coat in mammals
   occurs only in marsupials and monotremes. Intact coats are vital to
   marsupial embryonic development. Towards a better understanding of the
   marsupial coat proteins, a cDNA sequence (cp4) encoding a shell coat
   protein was cloned from the brushtail possum. A cDNA library of a zygote
   stage uterus was screened using a deduced oligonucleotide sequence based
   on a partial amino acid sequence of the coat protein. This study has
   confirmed a single copy cp4 gene encoding a unique protein of 306 amino
   acids, although its Nterminus shares high sequence identity with the
   C-terminal half of the enzyme alpha-enolase. Using Northern blots, the
   expression of cp4 in adult tissues showed that cp4 transcript is
   restricted predominantly to the uterus with two stages of expression
   occurring in the gravid uterus at early cleavage and bilaminar stages,
   suggesting an important developmental role for CP4. Using RT-PCR,
   cp4-specific expression as represented by the T-end 400 bp was present
   in heart, liver, oviduct, and uterus. Uterine expression reflected the
   increase found with Northern blot except that expression was low at
   unilaminar and bilaminar stages. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Vaccination strategies for the brushtail possum, which rely upon
   stimulation of mucosal immunity, are being developed for biocontrol
   purposes. As little is known about how to stimulate possum immune
   responses via a mucosal site, groups of possums were immunized
   intranasally with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) alone or in
   combination with known or novel mucosal adjuvants. Antigen-specific
   antibody titres in female reproductive secretions were measured by ELISA
   and compared with antibody titres in the serum. Antigen-induced
   lymphocyte proliferative responses were measured as an indicator of
   cell-mediated responses. Intranasal immunization with KLH alone
   stimulated a weak serum antibody response that was significantly
   increased when KLH was given with cholera toxin subunit B (CTB),
   recombinant possum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or live
   Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG). Antibody titres in
   secretions from ovarian follicles and the uterus were very low in
   animals administered KLH alone. Significantly higher antibody titres to
   KLH were present in the reproductive secretions of possums immunized
   with KLH plus CTB, BCG or heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae . Antibody
   titres were lower in mucosal secretions than in the serum, but there was
   a significant correlation between the two. In addition, coadministration
   of live BCG with KLH produced a strong antigen-specific cell-mediated
   response to KLH. This study has shown that an immune response to a
   protein antigen can be stimulated in possums by intranasal immunization
   and that antigen-specific antibodies can be detected in secretions from
   the female reproductive tract.},

Abstract = {A large-scale field experiment began in late 1995 to determine the
   effectiveness of fertility control for managing brushtail possum
   populations in New Zealand. Six study populations received one of three
   sterility treatments, either 0\%, 50\%, or 80\% of female possums
   sterilized by tubal ligation, with the level of sterility in each
   treatment maintained each year. Mark-recapture methods and analysis are
   being used to investigate the effect of the sterility treatments on
   demographic parameters such as population growth rate, survival, and
   recruitment. Recruitment of locally born young was successfully
   suppressed by sterility treatments, with lower yearling recruitment
   occurring on 80\% and 50\% sterility sites than on control sites.
   Negative population growth rate has been observed on one replicate set
   of 50\% and 80\% sterility sites, but growth rates have remained stable
   on the other replicate set of treatment sites. Examination of the
   contribution of immigrant animals to population growth rate has
   suggested that the settlement pattern of immigrants was compensating for
   reduced in situ recruitment. Analysis of survival rates revealed that
   sterile female possums had significantly higher survival rates than
   intact females, indicating a survival cost for reproduction. The effects
   of fertility control on the transmission rate of Leptospira interrogans
   serovar balcanica using a failure rate model revealed that the rate at
   which possums encounter leptospira infection in the treatment sites
   (80\% females sterile) was greater than the rate in control sites. As
   leptospira infection is believed to be spread by direct contact,
   increased transmission in the 80 \% sterility sites suggests that
   contact rates between possums (mating contacts) are higher in areas
   subject to fertility control. Increased transmission is hypothesised to
   be driven by the increased frequency of oestrus resulting from the
   method of sterilization (tubal ligation) that was used to model the
   potential effects of immunocontraception. This result has direct
   relevance to both the epidemiology of disease as well as the potential
   spread of any biocontrol vector that relies on direct contact for
   transmission.},

Abstract = {The interplay between ambient temperature and nutrition in wild
   herbivores is frequently overlooked, despite the fundamental importance
   of food. We tested whether different ambient temperatures (10 degrees C,
   18 degrees C and 26 degrees C) influenced the intake of protein by a
   marsupial herbivore, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula). At each temperature, possums were offered a choice of two
   foods containing different amounts of protein (57\% versus 8\%) for one
   week. Animals mixed a diet with a lower proportion of protein to
   non-protein (P : NP, 0.20) when held at 26 degrees C compared to that at
   both 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C (0.22). Since detoxification of plant
   secondary metabolites imposes a protein cost on animals, we then studied
   whether addition of the monoterpene 1,8-cineole to the food changed the
   effect of ambient temperature (10 degrees C and 26 degrees C) on food
   choice. Cineole reduced food intake but also removed the effect of
   temperature on P : NP ratio and instead animals opted for a diet with
   higher P : NP (0.19 with cineole versus 0.15 without cineole). These
   experiments show the proportion of P : NP chosen by animals is
   influenced by ambient temperature and by plant secondary metabolites.
   Protein is critical for reproductive success in this species and reduced
   protein intake caused by high ambient temperatures may limit the
   viability of some populations in the future.This article is part of the
   theme issue `Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals'.},

Abstract = {Ecological studies of common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula)
   in their extant range have been limited by technology and the species'
   nocturnal habit. However, camera traps now allow the investigation of
   possum ethology without observer interference. Here, we analysed
   terrestrial possum activity patterns using a large dataset collected
   over 3 years from 133 camera traps in mesic eucalypt woodland and open
   forest in three national parks on the New England Tablelands, New South
   Wales, Australia. We investigated how weather and moonlight intensity
   influenced possum activity patterns throughout the night, and across
   seasons and years, by using the timestamps assigned to each detection by
   the camera trap. Terrestrial possum activity increased as ambient
   temperatures decreased in autumn and peaked in winter when females were
   rearing offspring. Nightly possum detections decreased significantly
   with rain and increasing mean temperature. Possums were almost
   exclusively nocturnal, with most terrestrial activity earlier in the
   evening in winter and later at night in summer. During longer nights,
   higher temperatures also delayed activity. While nightly detection rates
   were not affected by lunar phase, possums preferred parts of the night
   with the highest moonlight intensity, and this effect was stronger on
   brighter nights. Overall, brushtail possums were most active on the
   ground when temperatures were mild and moonlight bright, presumably
   assisting foraging and predator avoidance, and during the breeding
   season; they avoided rain. These patterns suggest that reproduction,
   thermoregulation and risk of predation strongly shape the nocturnal
   activity cycle. Furthermore, our research adds to the evidence that
   camera traps can help greatly expand our knowledge of the ecology and
   behaviour of nocturnal mammals.},

Abstract = {Sperm capacitation and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) have been achieved
   in most eutherian mammals and American marsupials under relatively
   simple culture conditions. In contrast sperm capacitation in Australian
   marsupials has not been achieved in vitro and attempts at IVF have
   previously been characterised by a complete lack of sperm-zona pellucida
   (ZP) binding. Recently, co-culture of sperm with oviduct epithelial cell
   monolayers or with oviductal explant conditioned media has been shown to
   prolong the viability and motility of brushtail possum spermatozoa, as
   well as to induce capacitation-associated changes such as transformation
   of sperm to the T-shape orientation. In this study we report that these
   in vitro produced T-shaped sperm, and in vivo derived T-shaped sperm
   flushed from the oviduct of artificially inseminated possums as a
   control, are able to bind to and penetrate the ZP of approximately 25\%
   of eggs recovered from PMSG/LH-superovulated possums in vitro.
   Development of ZP receptivity and penetrability towards sperm was also
   identified as a major factor affecting the outcome of IVF. Neither in
   vivo nor in vitro derived T-shaped sperm were able to bind to or
   penetrate the ZP if eggs were obtained from animals that were treated
   with pLH less than 76 h after PMSG. Thus this study provides preliminary
   evidence for the necessity of sperm-oviduct epithelial cell interactions
   for capacitation in Australian species and lends further support to the
   suggestion that the T-shape head orientation is indicative of sperm
   capacitation. Despite the occurrence of sperm-ZP binding and
   penetration, sperm-egg membrane fusion and egg activation were not
   observed. Although the factor(s) responsible for the lack of sperm-egg
   membrane fusion in the possum have not been identified it is possible
   that egg capacity for membrane fusion develops independently of zona
   receptivity and is defective in these eggs, or alternatively that
   membrane fusion requires strictly defined ionic conditions which are not
   provided by the IVF media used in this study.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal and radial movements during spontaneous contractions of
   isolated segments of terminal ileum of the bruslitail possum, a species
   of arboreal folivore. were studied using high definition spatiotemporal
   maps. Segments obtained from specimens were continuously perfused with
   solutions of various apparent viscosities at 3 cm and 5 cm hydrostatic
   pressure. A series of sustained tetrodotoxin-sensitive peristaltic
   events occurred during perfusion. The leading edge of each peristaltic
   event progressed by a succession of rhythmic surges of circular
   contraction with concerted concurrent phasic longitudinal contractions.
   Three types of peristaltic event were observed. with differing durations
   of occlusion and patterns of cyclic. in phase, circular and longitudinal
   contractions. Each peristaltic event was preceded by a change of shade
   on the D map that indicated circumferential dilatation. Differences in
   the slopes of these phasic shade changes from those occurring during
   peristalsis indicate that this distension is passive and likely results
   from aboral displacement of fluid. Tetradotoxin insensitive longitudinal
   contraction waves of frequency 9.2 min(-1) occurred during and in the
   absence of peristalsis, originating at a variety of sites, and
   propagating either in an orad or aborad direction but predominantly in
   the latter. Perfusion with 1\% guar gum, at 5 cm hydrostatic pressure
   caused the lumen to become distended and the generation of peristaltic
   events to cease pending reduction of the hydrostatic head to 3 cm but
   longitudinal contractile activity was preserved. Neither the frequencies
   nor the rates of progression of circular and longitudinal contractile
   events, nor the temporal coordination between these events, varied with
   the apparent viscosity of the perfusate or altered in a manner that
   could facilitate mixing.},

Abstract = {This study describes progesterone receptor (PR) location within uterine
   cells and associated morphological changes to the uterine luminal and
   glandular epithelium in seasonally anoestrous brushtail possums treated
   with oestradiol and/or progesterone.
   Twenty-four adult female possums (n = 6/group) were treated with
   oestradiol, progesterone, oestradiol followed by progesterone or with
   the oil vehicle alone for 6-day periods. Uterine tissue was recovered,
   weighed and processed for light and transmission electron microscopy and
   for immunohistochemistry for PRs. Stereological techniques were used to
   quantify epithelial cell and constituent volumes for both luminal and
   glandular tissues. Plasma concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone
   were determined by radioimmunoassay.
   Mean uterine wet weights were significantly heavier (P < 0.001)
   following oestradiol/progesterone treatment and maximum gland dilation,
   cellular and stromal growth, maximum cell height, and cell and
   constituent volumes were recorded after this treatment regimen. Cell
   nuclei and debris were commonly observed in gland lumina, and nuclear
   PRs were found predominantly in stromal cells following oestradiol-only
   treatment. Sequential treatment with oestradiol and then progesterone
   caused a decline in the number of positively stained cells. Epithelial
   cells contained extensive secretory organelles and degenerating cells
   were common within the glands.
   Oestradiol treatment induced cell and cell constituent growth and
   promoted PR formation in anoestrous possum uterine tissue. Subsequent
   exposure to progesterone stimulated uterine tissues to reach maximum wet
   weights and led to the cellular maturation necessary to remodel the
   uterus in preparation for pregnancy.},

Abstract = {Intrinsic neurones of the gall bladder modulate its function. Nitric
   oxide synthase (NOS) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are
   present in gall bladder neurones and nitric oxide and VIP modulate its
   epithelial functions. As an extensive extrinsic innervation of the gall
   bladder is also present, the source of the epithelial innervation is
   unclear. In this study the source of the gall bladder epithelial
   innervation is defined. Immunoreactivity for VIP, NOS, substance P (SP),
   calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in
   organotypic cultured and freshly fixed gall bladder were compared.
   Retrograde tracing in vitro from the epithelium was used to identify
   putative intrinsic secretomotor neurones, which were then characterized
   by immunohistochemistry. Abundant spinal afferent and sympathetic
   innervation of the gall bladder epithelium was demonstrated by CGRP/SP
   and TH immunohistochemistry, respectively. The intrinsic secretomotor
   innervation of the epithelium is derived exclusively from neurones of
   the subepithelial plexus. A majority of these neurones were
   immunoreactive for NOS. Some of the NOS-immunoreactive neurones of the
   subepithelial plexus also contained VIP and/or SP. Gall bladder
   subepithelial plexus neurones, containing NOS and/or VIP/SP, innervate
   the epithelium, as do extrinsic neurones.},

Abstract = {Brushtail possums exhibit a distinct preovulatory pattern of prolactin
   (Prl) secretion suggesting that Prl is involved in normal reproductive
   function. In some mammals, Prl is essential for corpus luteum (CL)
   function and/or modulation of steroidal effects on
   hypothalamic-pituitary activity. The aim of this study was to test the
   effects of biologically active recombinant possum Prl (recPosPrl) on
   both pituitary gland and CL function in possums. To confirm biological
   activity, administration of recPosPrl-N2C1 (10 mu g) resulted in an
   18-fold stimulation (P <0.05) of progesterone (P-4) production by possum
   granulosa cells in vitro. Based on these findings, minipumps containing
   either recPosPrl-N2C1 (n = 10) or saline (n = 8) were inserted into
   lactating female possums. The expression levels of pituitary-derived
   PRL, LHB, FSHB and GNRHR and CL-derived LHR mRNA were quantified.
   Following a resumption of reproductive activity, no differences in
   ovulation incidence or plasma Prl concentrations were observed. Plasma
   Prl levels were less variable (P < 0.001) in Prl-treated possums,
   confirming a self-regulatory role for Prl in this species. There was a
   marked down-regulation (P < 0.001) of FSHB mRNA at the mid-luteal stage
   in Prl-treated possums, whereas mean PRL, LHB, GNRHR and LHR mRNA
   expression levels were not different between experimental groups. Plasma
   P-4 concentrations were not different (P = 0.05) in Prl-treated possums,
   although tended to be higher in the pen-ovulatory and early-luteal
   phase. We conclude in the brushtail possum that Prl is self-regulated
   via a short-feedback loop common to all mammals studied and is able to
   modulate FSHB expression probably at the level of the hypothalamus
   and/or pituitary gland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Demography in relation to population density in two herbivorous
   marsupials: testing for source-sink dynamics versus independent
   regulation of population size},

Abstract = {We compared demography of populations along gradients of population
   density in two medium-sized herbivorous marsupials, the common brushtail
   possum Trichosurus vulpecula and the rufous bettong Aepyprymnus
   rufescens, to test for net dispersal from high density populations
   (acting as sources) to low density populations (sinks). In both species,
   population density was positively related to soil fertility, and
   variation in soil fertility produced large differences in population
   density of contiguous populations. We predicted that if source-sink
   dynamics were operating over this density gradient, we should find
   higher immigration rates in low-density populations, and positive
   relationships of measures of individual fitness-body condition,
   reproductive output, juvenile growth rates and survivorship-to
   population density. This was predicted because under source-sink
   dynamics, immigration from high-density sites would hold population
   density above carrying capacity in low-density sites. The study included
   13 populations of these two species, representing a more than 50-fold
   range of density for each species, but we found that individual fitness,
   immigration rates and population turnover were similar in all
   populations. We conclude that net dispersal from high to low density
   populations had little influence on population dynamics in these
   species; rather, all populations appeared to be independently regulated
   at carrying capacity, with a balanced exchange of dispersers among
   populations. These two species have suffered recent reductions in range,
   and they are ecologically similar to other species that have declined to
   extinction in inland Australia. It has been argued that part of the
   cause of the vulnerability of species like these is that they exhibit
   source-sink dynamics, and disturbance to source habitats can therefore
   cause large-scale population collapses. The results of our study argue
   against this interpretation.},

Title = {Seasonal changes in RFamide-related peptide-3 neurons in the
   hypothalamus of a seasonally breeding marsupial species, the brushtail
   possum (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>)},

Year = {2013},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) neurons have been shown to inhibit
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal activity and hence
   reproduction in birds and eutherian mammals. They have also been
   proposed to have a direct hypophysiotropic effect on pituitary
   gonadotropin release. We used a new RFRP-3 antibody to characterize the
   cell body distribution and fiber projections of RFRP-3 neurons in the
   adult female brushtail possum brain. RFRP-3-immunoreactive cell bodies
   were found scattered within the dorsomedial hypothalamus and the
   dorsomedial half of the ventromedial hypothalamus, while GnRH neurons
   were observed scattered rostrocaudally along the lateral septum, rostral
   to the medial septum. There was a significant 2-fold increase in the
   RFRP-3 cell body number during the nonbreeding season (summer) compared
   to the breeding season (winter). Immunoreactive RFRP-3 fibers were
   distributed throughout the thalamus, preoptic area, and hypothalamus.
   Very few fibers were observed in the median eminence, especially in the
   external zone. Intraperitoneal injection of the retrograde tracer
   Fluoro-Gold resulted in the labeling of 40\% of hypophysiotropic
   tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons;
   however, <10\% of zona incerta dopaminergic neurons (which are not
   hypophysiotropic) or RFRP-3 neurons were labeled with this tracer. These
   observations suggest that RFRP-3 exhibits a seasonal fluctuation in cell
   numbers, as seen in sheep and birds, which is consistent with an
   increased inhibitory tone during the nonbreeding season. The lack of
   RFRP-3 fibers in the median eminence and of Fluoro-Gold uptake from the
   periphery imply that the actions of this peptide occur primarily
   centrally rather than at the anterior pituitary gland. J. Comp. Neurol.

Abstract = {Background-Gall bladder functions are modulated by neurones intrinsic to
   the organ. Data are available on the neurochemical composition of
   intrinsic and extrinsic nerves innervating the gall bladder but are
   lacking on specific functional classes of gall bladder, neurones.
   Aims-To characterise the intrinsic motor neurones of the gall bladder
   and identify their roles using pharmacological techniques.
   Methods-Retrograde tracing from the possum gall bladder muscle in vitro
   allowed identification of intrinsic motor neurones., Subsequently, their
   content of choline acetyltransferase and nitric oxide synthase, markers
   of acetylcholine and nitric oxide containing neurones, was established
   using immunohistochemical. techniques. Organ bath pharmacology was used
   to evaluate neurotransmission by acetylcholine and nitric oxide in gall
   bladder muscle strips.
   Results-Innervation of the gall bladder musculature by neurones, of both
   the muscular and serosal plexuses was demonstrated. A large proportion
   (62\%) of these motor neurones were immunoreactive for nitric oxide
   synthase. All gall bladder neurones, showed immunoreactivity for choline
   acetyltransferase. Organ bath pharmacology confirmed the neuroanatomical
   data, showing acetylcholine and nitric oxide mediating neurotransmission
   to the gall bladder musculature.
   Conclusions-Neurones containing acetylcholine and nitric oxide, located
   within the muscular and serosal plexuses, provide excitatory and
   inhibitory motor innervation of the gall bladder, respectively. The
   large inhibitory innervation suggests active relaxation of the
   gallbladder during filling, mediated by intrinsic nerves.},

Abstract = {Mast cell populations in the vaginal cul-de-sac of female brushtail
   possums do not appear to be related to microbial invasion but changes in
   their density occur at oestrus, indicating a hormonal influence. The
   present study examined the effect of treatment with oestradiol on
   microflora and on mast cell numbers and their spatial location in
   cul-de-sac tissue of seasonally anoestrous brushtail possums. Tissue was
   collected from seasonally anoestrous brushtail possums (n = 6 per group)
   that were either untreated (anoestrous group) or were subjected to 6
   days of treatment with oestradiol (oestradiol group) administered via
   subcutaneous implants or with the oil vehicle alone (control group).
   Tissue was collected aseptically for microbiological procedures and the
   fractionator and optical disector were used to quantify mast cell
   populations. Microflora populations were low (< 4.0 x 10(4) organisms
   g(-1)) and numbers of mast cells were similar in all groups. Mast cell
   density was greatest in epithelial and connective tissues from
   seasonally anoestrous and control animals and lowest in
   oestradiol-treated possums, in which there was a significant increase in
   cul-de-sac mass and volume. There is an inverse relationship between
   circulating oestrogen concentrations and mast cell density in possum
   cul-de-sac tissue, which is probably the result of an increase in tissue
   volume.},

Title = {A faecal index of diet quality that predicts reproductive success in a

Abstract = {Estimating the nutritional value of a herbivore's diet is difficult
   because it requires knowing what the animal eats, the relative quality
   of each component and how these components interact in relation to
   animal physiology. Current methods are cumbersome and rely on many
   assumptions that are hard to evaluate. We describe a new method for
   estimating relative diet quality directly from faeces that avoids the
   problems inherent in other methods. We combine this method with near
   infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to analyse many samples and
   thus provide a technique with immense value in ecological studies. The
   method stems from the correlation between the concentrations of dietary
   and faecal nitrogen in herbivores eating a tannin-free diet, but a
   weaker relationship in browsers that ingest substantial amounts of
   tannins, which form complexes with proteins. These complexes reduce the
   availability of nitrogen and may increase faecal nitrogen
   concentrations. Using the tannin-binding compound, polyethylene glycol,
   we showed that tannin-bound nitrogen is a significant and variable part
   of faecal nitrogen in wild common brushtail possums (Trichosurus
   vulpecula). We developed a technique to measure faecal available
   nitrogen and found that it predicted the reproductive success of female
   brushtail possums in northern Australia. Faecal available nitrogen
   combined with NIRS provides a powerful tool for estimating the relative
   nutritional value of the diets of browsing herbivores in many ecological
   systems. It is a better indicator of diet quality than other commonly
   used single-nutrient measures such as faecal nitrogen and foliage
   analysis paired with observed feeding behaviour.},

Abstract = {Both LH and FSH play a central role in controlling ovarian function in
   mammals. However, little is known about the type of ovarian cells that
   are responsive to LH and FSH in marsupials. We determined, using in situ
   hybridization, the localization of mRNA encoding the receptors (R) for
   LH and FSH in ovaries of brushtail possums. The mRNA encoding FSH-R was
   observed in granulosa cells of healthy follicles containing at least two
   complete layers of cells. The mRNA encoding LH-R was first observed in
   granulosa cells at the time of antrum formation. Cells of the theca
   interna expressed LH-R mRNA but not FSH-R mRNA. Neither FSH-R nor LH-R
   mRNA was detected in atretic follicles. Both FSH-R and LH-R mRNAs were
   observed in luteal tissue, but only LH-R mRNA was observed in
   interstitial cells. Granulosa cells from follicles of various sizes (0.5
   to >2 mm in diameter) responded to LH and FSH treatment with an increase
   in cAMP synthesis. In contrast, luteal tissue did not respond to either
   FSH or LH treatment. In conclusion, expression of FSH-R in the brushtail
   possum ovary was similar to that observed in many eutherian mammals.
   However, active LH-R was expressed in granulosa cells much earlier in
   follicular development than has been previously observed. In addition,
   although mRNAs for both FSH-R and LH-R were observed, neither FSH nor LH
   treatment stimulated cAMP synthesis in luteal tissue.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the effect of halothane anesthesia on the motility of the
   sphincter of Oddi and simultaneous transsphincteric flow in Australian
   Brush-tailed possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Halothane levels in the
   range of 0.25 to 2\% were administered and decreased transsphincteric

   higher than normal, but not in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally,
   halothane anesthesia influenced the sphincter of Oddi motility by
   decreasing the motility index (mean amplitude multiplied by frequency of
   contractions). This decrease was dose dependent. These findings indicate
   that sphincter of Oddi basal pressure is a major component of sphincter
   of Oddi motility responsible for regulating transsphincteric flow in
   this species. For studies of the sphincter of Oddi motility in
   anesthetized Australian Brush-tailed possums, we recommend anesthetic
   induction with ketamine (50 mg/kg, i.m.) and the inspired halothane
   level should not exceed 0.75\% during the study period, as the effects
   we have demonstrated were most evident at levels greater than 0.75\%. If
   higher halothane levels are required to maintain satisfactory
   anesthesia, an alternative anesthetic agent should be considered.},

Title = {Landscape-scale analysis of nutritional traits of New Zealand tree
   foliage using near-infrared spectroscopy},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {357},
Pages = {161-170},

Abstract = {Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to predict the
   nutritional quality of tree foliage from a New Zealand forest inhabited
   by the introduced common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as
   part of a study to understand the relationship between possum browsing
   and the nutritional quality of foliage. The traits of interest were the
   foliar concentrations of total nitrogen, in vitro dry matter
   digestibility, and available nitrogen (with and without incubation with
   polyethylene glycol to indicate the effect of tannins). A total of 1399
   samples from five plant species were studied, with 650 included in a
   calibration set and 50 in a separate validation set. We evaluated the
   performance of classic (GLOBAL) and alternative (LOCAL) calibration
   techniques. Both were successful, although a GLOBAL equation
   incorporating all calibration samples was used for the final
   predictions. Modelling of the spectra enabled the nutritional quality of
   the foliage samples to be estimated with coefficients of determination
   (r(2)) of 0.83-0.99 using modified partial least-squares regression.
   Nutritional quality varied both within and between five tree species for
   which possums show varied preferences. The predictive models developed
   in this study facilitate landscape-scale ecological investigations into
   the role of plant nutrients on the behaviour and demography of
   introduced herbivores. This provides new opportunities to test theories
   on invasiveness and to prioritize landscapes for conservation and possum
   control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in cellular proteins is a major
   signal transduction event during sperm capacitation. In this study
   protein phosphorylation was monitored using a fluorescein isothiocyanate
   (FITC)-labeled antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and a flow
   cytometric procedure optimized for sperm. Using this technique, the
   correlation between tyrosine phosphorylation and sperm capacitation was
   examined in two marsupial species, the brushtail possum and the tammar
   wallaby and compared with that of ram spermatozoa. The levels of
   tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm from all three species were increased
   by the addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and vandate, a phosphotyrosine
   phosphatase inhibitor and were decreased by the addition of the
   phosphotyrosine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. Oviductal conditioned
   media (CM) induced a progressive increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in
   both marsupial species and also induced morphological transition from a
   streamlined to a `T'-shape configuration in brushtail possum spermatozoa
   but not in tammar wallaby spermatozoa. Transition to the `T'-shape
   orientation associated with capacitation in marsupial spermatozoa was
   observed by 2 h of incubation in both species when tyrosine
   phosphorylation was increased by higher levels of cAMP i.e. 5 mM
   dibutyryl cAMP plus 3 mM pentoxyphylline. Thus the tyrosine
   phosphorylation trigger with CM may differ in these two marsupial
   species. Ram sperm tyrosine phosphorylation could be increased by
   addition of lower levels of cAMP (1 mM). These results support the
   finding that tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with sperm
   capacitation in marsupials. Similar results were obtained by using SDS
   PAGE/Western blot analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation in the brushtail
   possum spermatozoa. The specificity, efficiency and sensitivity of the
   procedure described here make it applicable for routine assessment of
   capacitation in large numbers of samples and in other species.},

Abstract = {In eutherian mammals, the gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) are synthesized
   and stored in gonadotroph cells under the regulation of multiple
   mechanisms including GnRH. Very little is known about the regulation of
   gonadotrophin secretion and storage in pituitary glands of marsupials.
   This study revealed, using quantitative PCR and heterologous RIA
   techniques, that LHB mRNA expression levels remained constant over the
   oestrous cycle, regardless of the presence of a preovulatory LH surge,
   which is characteristic of a hormone secreted under regulation. Our
   sampling regime was unable to detect pulses of LH during the follicular
   phase, although GNRHR mRNA levels had increased at this time. Pulses of
   LH were, however, detected in the luteal phase of cycling females, in
   anoestrus females and in males. There was a positive correlation between
   gene expression of FSHB and plasma levels of FSH at different stages of
   the oestrous cycle and no pulses of FSH were detected at any time; all
   characteristics of a hormone secreted via the constitutive pathway.
   Using in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry methods, we
   determined that mRNA expression of LHB and FSHB, and protein storage of
   gonadotrophins exhibited a similar pattern of localisation within the
   pituitary gland. Additionally, sexual dimorphism of gonadotroph
   populations was evident. in summary, these findings are similar to that
   reported in eutherians and considering that marsupial evolution diverged
   from eutherians over 100 million years ago suggests that the regulation
   of gonadotrophins is highly conserved indeed.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to determine which ovarian cells
   express mRNAs for oestrogen (ER alpha and ER beta), androgen (AR) and
   progesterone (PR) receptors during ovarian and follicular development in
   the brushtail possum. Expression of ER alpha and/or ER beta mRNA was
   observed from birth, initially in cells of the blastema, then in the
   medullary cords from Day 20. ER alpha was expressed in the oocytes and
   granulosa cells of secondary and antral follicles. Preovulatory
   follicles did not express ER alpha mRNA, although their oocytes were not
   examined for any gene. ER beta mRNA was observed in oocytes at all
   follicular stages examined, but was not consistently observed in
   granulosa or theca cells. Expression of AR mRNA before Day 40 was very
   faint; thereafter, expression was observed in the medullary cords,
   peaking between Days 60 and 120. Oocytes, granulosa cells and theca of
   secondary and antral, but not preovulatory, follicles expressed AR mRNA.
   PR mRNA was expressed throughout the gonad by Day 20. Granulosa cells of
   some secondary and antral follicles and theca of antral follicles
   expressed PR mRNA. Thus, the expression of mRNAs encoding steroidogenic
   receptors in a time- and cell-specific manner supports a role for
   steroids in the process of ovarian follicular formation and growth.},

Abstract = {The prostate of the brushtail possum undergoes growth and regression
   during the year. The present study investigated the morphological
   changes and expression of androgen and oestrogen receptors during the
   breeding and non-breeding seasons. Prostate tissue was collected from
   adult possums at 2-monthly intervals. The periurethral and outer
   glandular areas were separated and the volume of stromal, epithelial and
   luminal tissues measured in each area. Immunohistochemistry was used to
   investigate cell proliferation with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
   (PCNA) and to localise androgen receptor (AR) and oestrogen receptors
   alpha and beta (ER alpha, ER beta). Seasonal changes in expression of
   the three receptors were investigated using quantitative PCR and western
   blot analysis. During the breeding season the volume of stromal tissue
   in the periurethral area and the luminal volume in the glandular area
   significantly increased. The change in periurethral volume was
   associated with increased PCNA-immunopositive cells. While the
   localisation of AR to the stromal and epithelial cells did not change,
   there was a significant increase in receptor expression before the main
   breeding season. ER alpha and ER beta expression and localisation did
   not alter during the year. Similarities in receptor expression and
   localisation suggest that the possum may be a suitable animal model for
   the study of human prostate growth.},

Title = {Spermatozoa from a marsupial, the brushtail possum, contain
   β1,4-galactosyltransferase},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {402-407},
Abstract = {beta 1,4-Galactosyltransferase-I (GalTase-I) is one of the key molecules
   on the sperm surface of eutherian mammals that is likely to be involved
   in binding to the egg coat, the zona pellucida, to mediate sperm-egg
   interaction. In laboratory mice, the species for which most data are
   available, this protein functions as a receptor for the zona pellucida
   protein ZP3 of the oocyte and, upon binding, triggers the sperm acrosome
   reaction. In the present study, we investigated the presence and
   abundance of GalTase-I in epididymal sperm extracts of a marsupial, the
   brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula. For this, spermatozoa were
   collected from cauda epididymides and the amount of beta
   1,4-galactosyltransferase activity in washed sperm extracts was compared
   with that of porcine spermatozoa. Overall beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase
   enzyme activity was found to be more abundant in possum sperm extracts
   than those from porcine spermatozoa (P < 0.05). Immunoblots with an
   antibody to mouse GalTase-I revealed that the molecular weight of possum
   spermatozoa GalTase-I was 66 kDa, which is similar to the molecular
   weight of GalTase-I in spermatozoa from eutherian mammals. The molecular
   weight of GalTase-I was the same in sperm extracts collected from the
   caput and cauda epididymides. These results demonstrate that GalTase-I
   is indeed present in possum spermatozoa and thus it may be a gamete
   receptor molecule on the sperm surface of marsupials as well as those of
   eutherian mammals.},

Title = {Acrosome stability in the spermatozoa of dasyurid marsupials},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {295-302},
Abstract = {The spermatozoa of most marsupials lack nuclear stabilising
   disulfide-bonded protamines found in eutherian mammals. However,
   disulfide stabilisation has been observed in the acrosome of macropodid
   (Macropus eugenii) and phalangerid (Trichosurus vulpecula) marsupials.
   As a result this organelle, which is normally fragile in eutherian
   mammals, is robust and able to withstand physical and chemical challenge
   in these marsupials. The present study examined acrosomal
   characteristics of the spermatozoa of three dasyurid marsupials; the
   fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), eastern quoll (Dasyurus
   viverrinus) and northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus). In all species
   examined Bryan's staining demonstrated that significant acrosomal loss
   occurred following physical challenge with osmotic stress,
   cryopreservation without cryoprotectant and exposure to detergent
   (Triton-X). Bromobimane staining indicated that the acrosomes of
   dasyurids lacked stabilising disulfide bonds. As reported for the
   wallaby and possum, calcium ionophore (A23187) did not induce the
   acrosome reaction-like exocytosis in dasyurid spermatozoa but treatment
   with diacylglycerol (DiC(8)) caused significant acrosome loss at
   concentrations similar to those effective for other marsupials. The
   present study found that the spermatozoa of dasyurids are more sensitive
   to physical challenge than the previously-studied marsupials and we
   suggest that this is due to the absence of acrosomal stabilising
   disulfide bonds.},

Title = {The conservation value of mesic gullies in dry forest landscapes: mammal
   populations in the box-ironbark ecosystem of southern Australia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Within the context of landscape variation in habitat quality, areas of
   unusually high productivity may serve as refuges for fauna during
   environmentally stressful periods and as sources of recruitment into
   less productive areas. In dry landscapes, water availability often
   defines habitat quality, so that drainages that concentrate run-off can
   facilitate relatively lush, and sometimes distinct, vegetation
   communities. The dry box-ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia may
   be such an ecosystem. Recent clearing of vegetation for agriculture and
   mining has eliminated 85\% of the original vegetation in this area, with
   the fertile, alluvial soils being most affected. Fragmentation and
   degradation of remnant forest in this ecosystem has increased the
   potential importance of the remaining high-quality habitat to
   conservation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the abundance
   of mammals was higher in moist gullies than on dry hilltops, slopes and
   ridges in the box-ironbark forests of central Victoria. We compared 57
   spatially paired gully and ridge sites. Habitat analyses indicated that
   gullies had a tree canopy height that was 51\% taller than on ridges,
   53\% more trees with hollows in the upper bole and branches, and almost
   six times more very large trees. Ridges had 71\% more small trees than
   gullies. Among marsupials surveyed, the common brushtail possum
   Trichosurus vulpecula and common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus
   peregrinus were significantly more abundant in gullies. Nearly all the
   reproduction observed in these two species occurred in gullies. The
   yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus flavipes was also significantly more
   abundant in gullies; numbers of the sugar glider Petaurus breviceps
   differed little. Whereas gullies occupy a very limited total area in
   this ecosystem, they may nonetheless be critical to some species of
   mammals that can survive in dry habitats but thrive only in mesic areas.
   Given the precariously degraded state of the box-ironbark ecosystem as a
   whole, protection of gullies from proposed alluvial gold mining and
   timber harvesting could have a disproportionate benefit to biodiversity
   conservation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The possum is a major invasive pest in New Zealand. One option for its
   control is the use of immunocontraceptive vaccines. Initial trials of
   vaccines have shown individual variation in response. The use of
   vaccines on wild populations could result in the evolution of a
   resistant population through selection for possums that remain fertile
   because of low or no response. Understanding the basis of this variation
   is therefore important. The major histocompatibility, complex (MHC) is
   an important influence on the nature of immune responses. This study has
   investigated the relationship between MHC alleles and individual immune
   responses to immunocontraceptive vaccines comprising zona pellucida
   peptides. We identified MHC alleles and putative haplotypes, and
   compared these between individuals with measured responses to
   immunocontraceptive vaccines. Two haplotypes were found to associate
   significantly with differences in vaccine response. Possums that carried
   haplotype 6 showed reduced responsiveness to one vaccine, while possums
   that carried haplotype 9 showed increased responsiveness to a separate
   vaccine. The identification of MHC haplotypes associated with different
   responses to immunocontraceptive vaccines offers the opportunity to
   understand what factors trigger non-response and the persistence of
   fertility in some individuals, and may allow vaccines to be optimised to
   minimise non-responsiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Acrosomal loss was induced in marsupial spermatozoa by an intermediate
   of the phosphoinositide pathway. The diacylglycerol,
   1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC(8); 100 mu mol l(-1)) induced acrosomal
   loss in 70\% of brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) spermatozoa and
   in 80\% of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) spermatozoa. The
   DiC(8)-induced acrosomal loss was not enhanced by co-incubation with
   calcium ionophore A23187 and occurred in Ca2+ free medium and in the
   presence of the calcium chelator EGTA (3 mmol l(-1)). There was no
   evidence of uptake of Ca-45(2+) during the DiC(8)-induced acrosomal
   loss. Inhibitors of protein kinase C
   {[}1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine] and phospholipase
   A(2) {[}dexamethasone] did not effect DiC(8)-induced acrosomal loss in
   wallaby spermatozoa. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate,
   at a concentration of 10 mu mol l(-1) had no effect on possum
   spermatozoa and induced acrosomal loss in only 6\% of wallaby
   spermatozoa. It appears that the DiC(8)-induced acrosome reaction is not
   mediated by activation of the phosphoinositide pathway and that
   extracellular calcium is not required for the membrane fusion event. As
   acrosomal loss was seen only at relatively high concentrations of
   diacylglycerol (>50 mu mol l(-1)) and there is no evidence of
   involvement of other phosphoinositide intermediates or analogues, it is
   likely that its role is as a direct membrane fusogen.},

Abstract = {The acrosome of marsupial spermatozoa is a robust structure which,
   unlike its placental counterpart, resists disruption by detergent or
   freeze/thawing and does not undergo a calcium ionophore induced acrosome
   reaction. In this study specific fluorescent thiol labels, bromobimanes,
   were used to detect reactive thiols in the intact marsupial spermatozoon
   and examine whether disulfides play a role in the stability of the
   acrosome. Ejaculated brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and tammar
   wallaby (Macropus eugenil) spermatozoa were washed by swim up and
   incubated with or without dithiothreitol (DTT) in order to reduce
   disulfides to reactive thiols. Spermatozoa were then washed by
   centrifugation and treated with monobromobimane (mBBr), a
   membrane-permeable bromobimane, or with monobromotrimethylammoniobimane
   (qBBr), a membrane-impermeable bromobimane. Labelled spermatozoa were
   examined by fluorescence microscopy and sperm proteins (whole sperm
   proteins and basic nuclear proteins) were analysed by gel
   electrophoresis. The membrane-permeable agent mBBr lightly labelled the
   perimeter of the acrosome of non-DTT-treated possum and wallaby
   spermatozoa, indicating the presence of peri-acrosomal thiol groups.
   After reduction of sperm disulfides by DTT, mBBr labelled the entire
   acrosome of both species. The membrane-impermeable agent qBBr did not
   label any part of the acrosome in non-DTT or DTT-treated wallaby or
   possum spermatozoa. Thiols and disulfides are thus associated with the
   marsupial acrosome. They are not found on the overlying plasma membrane
   but are either in the acrosomal membranes and/or matrix. The sperm
   midpiece and tail were labelled by mBBr, with increased fluorescence
   observed in DTT-treated spermatozoa. The nucleus was not labelled in
   non-DTT or DTT-treated spermatozoa. Electrophoretic analysis confirmed
   the microscopic observations: Basic nuclear proteins (protamines) lacked
   thiols or disulfide groups. Based on these findings, the stability of
   the marsupial acrosome may be due in part to disulfide stabilization of
   the acrosomal membranes and/or acrosomal matrix. In common with
   placental mammals, thiol and disulfide containing proteins appear to
   play a role in the stability of sperm tail structures. It was confirmed
   that the fragile marsupial sperm nucleus lacked thiols and disulfides.

Abstract = {Immune-based fertility control is being considered as an effective
   long-term approach for controlling the pest brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) population in New Zealand. This relies heavily
   on the immune response of each immunised possum. A strong and lasting
   immune response in the majority of individuals in a population is
   essential. In this study, possums and the model macropod species, the
   tammar wallaby ( Macropus eugenii) were immunised with either a
   luteinising hormone or androgen receptor synthetic peptide coupled to
   the carrier molecule KLH ( keyhole limpet haemocyanin). The antibody
   response of wallabies to the antigens was relatively uniform. In
   contrast, the possum immunoglobulin response to both synthetic peptides
   and KLH was variable. The apparent high level of variation in the immune
   response of possums raises questions about the feasibility of using
   these two antigens to control possum numbers in New Zealand.},

Abstract = {Tammar wallaby spermatozoa undergo maturation during transit through the
   epididymis. This maturation differs from that seen in eutherian mammals
   because in addition to biochemical and functional maturation there are
   also major changes in morphology, in particular formation of the
   condensed acrosome and reorientation of the sperm head and tail. Of
   spermatozoa released from the testes, 83 \% had a large immature
   acrosome. By the time spermatozoa reached the proximal cauda epididymis
   100 \% of sperm had condensed acrosomes. Similarly 86 \% of testicular
   spermatozoa had immature thumb tack or T shape head-tail orientation
   while only 2 \% retained this immature morphology in the corpus
   epididymis. This maturation is very similar to that reported for the
   common brush tail possum. Trichosurus vulpecula. However, morphological
   maturation occurred earlier in epididymal transit in the tammar wallaby.
   By the time spermatozoa had reached the proximal cauda epididymis no
   spermatozoa had an immature acrosome and thumbtack orientation.
   Associated with acrosomal maturation was an increase in acrosomal thiols
   and the formation of disulphides which presumably account for the
   unusual stability of the wallaby sperm acrosome. The development of
   motility and progressive motility of tammar wallaby spermatozoa is
   similar to that of other marsupials and eutherian mammals. Spermatozoa
   are immotile in the testes and the percentage of motile spermatozoa and
   the strength of their motility increases during epididymal transit.
   During passage through the caput and corpus epididymis, spermatozoa
   first became weakly motile in the proximal caput and then increasingly
   progressively motile through the corpus epididymis. Tammar wallaby
   spermatozoa collected from the proximal cauda epididymis had motility
   not different from ejaculated spermatozoa. Ultrastructural studies
   indicated that acrosomal condensation involved a complex infolding of
   the immature acrosome. At spermiation the acrosome of tammar wallaby
   spermatozoa was a relatively large flat or concave disc which projected
   laterally and anteriorly beyond the limits of the nucleus, During
   transit of the epididymal caput and proximal corpus the lateral
   projections folded inwards to form a cup like structure the sides of
   which eventually met and fused. The cavity produced by this fusion was
   lost as the acrosome condensed to its mature form as a small button-like
   structure contained within the depression on the anterior end of the
   nucleus. During this process the dorsal surface of the immature acrosome
   and its outer acrosomal membrane and overlying plasma membrane were
   engulfed into the acrosomal matrix. This means that the dorsal surface
   of the acrosomal region of the testicular tammar wallaby sperm head is a
   transient structure. The dorsal acrosomal surface of the mature
   spermatozoon appears ultrastructurally to be the relocated ventral
   surface of the acrosomal projections which previously extended out
   beyond the acrosomal depression on the dorsal surface of the nucleus of
   the immature spermatozoon.},

Abstract = {Many studies in molecular ecology have focused on the use of repeat DNA
   markers to determine the nature of mating systems in a wide variety of
   animal species. Whilst these studies typically have focused on important
   issues such as the evolutionary consequences of fitness variation among
   males, genetic studies of mating systems are potentially also important
   because they can generate information of significance to wider issues in
   wildlife management. For example, genetically modified, sexually
   transmitted viral diseases have been suggested as potential agents for
   the control of vertebrate pest species. An understanding of the
   epidemiology of such agents requires an intimate knowledge of the sexual
   contact rates between individuals of the target species. Here, we report
   the use of minisatellite DNA profiling to reveal the mating system in
   two New Zealand populations of the introduced Australian brushtail
   possum. The brushtail possum is New Zealand's most important mammalian
   pest and a species for which control by a sexually transmitted
   immunocontraceptive has been proposed. Encouragingly, we report
   considerable variation in the reproductive success of males at both
   study sites, with one male siring offspring from four females in one
   year (mean no. of offspring/reproductively successful male/year at the
   two sites is 1.95-2.15), while many sired none. This bias in the pattern
   of reproductive success among males will probably facilitate the spread
   of an immunocontraceptive agent and thereby increase the power of this
   approach to biological control.},

Abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that as organisms approach the end of their
   life, they should increase their reproductive effort (RE). However,
   studies on mammals often find that measures of RE do not vary with
   maternal age. This might be because offspring have some control over
   energy transfer which may constrain adaptive variation in RE by mothers,
   particularly in eutherian mammals where placental function is primarily
   controlled by offspring. However, in marsupials, energy transfer is
   primarily by lactation and under maternal control, leaving marsupial
   mothers free to vary RE. Here, we provide the first analysis, to our
   knowledge, of age-specific RE in a marsupial, the common brushtail
   possum. RE, measured as the proportion of maternal mass lost during
   lactation, was strongly correlated with offspring mass as a yearling.
   Older females had higher RE, gave birth earlier in the season and were
   more likely to produce two offspring in a year. Females with high RE in
   one year were fighter at the beginning of the next breeding season.
   These results provide the clearest support yet for terminal RE in a
   mammal.},

Abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the nuclear topology of spermatozoa
   from two marsupial species, Sminthopsis crassicaudata and Trichosurus
   vulpecula was investigated to determine the structural organisation of
   the chromatin subunits. That of the former species is of special
   interest as it has a peripheral nucleohistone region (C2) as well as a
   nuclease-resistant, nucleoprotamine core region (C1). Atomic force
   microscopy showed that the C2 region contained clusters of 120-160 nm
   nodules, whereas the C1 region exhibited smaller 50-80 nm nodules. The
   spermatozoa nuclei of Trichosurus, which has mainly nucleoprotamines,
   contained higher order chromatin structures of similar size to those
   from the C1 region of Sminthopsis. This study shows that nucleohistones
   and nucleoprotamines of marsupial sperm form distinct higher order
   conformations. For the second part of this work, the chromatin density
   and affinity for cationic stains of Sminthopsis spermatozoa were
   determined. Spermatozoa were observed with the transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) either unstained or stained with metal salts. In the
   unstained specimens, the C2 nucleohistone region appeared more
   electron-lucent than the C1 region. When large cations such as uranyl
   were used, the reverse situation was observed. Therefore, the
   electron-dense appearance of the C2 chromatin in conventionally stained
   material may be due to the presence of net negative DNA charges that
   attract the cations used for EM staining, whereas the C1 chromatin may
   lack excess DNA negative charges that attract these stains and thus
   appears less electron-dense. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {(1) Deterministic disease/host models based on differential equations,
   with and without age-structure, are used to aid understanding of the
   epidemiology of bovine Tb in New Zealand's possum Trichosurus vulpecula
   populations.
   (2) The intrinsic rate of increase for possums is calculated to be
   0.2-0.3 year-1, density dependence is associated more with mortality
   than recruitment and affects all age-classes.
   (3) Bovine Tb in possums is characterized by low prevalence, around 5\%,
   little effect on host density but moderately rapid dynamics.  Its
   behaviour cannot be accounted for by the classic models which assume
   homogenous mixing.  In these models low prevalence is invariably
   associated either with a significant reduction in host density or
   extremely slow rates of change of the disease.
   (4) The classic models are therefore modified to include spatial
   aggregation of disease, which is quantified using field data.
   (5) Three scenarios for the disease are considered which agree with
   observations:  chronic disease with a short latent period relative to
   the infectious period (e.g. 6 months and 1.5 years respectively) and
   most animals with gross lesions infectious; acute disease with a
   relatively long latent period (e.g. 1 year latent period and 3 months
   infectious period) and few animals with gross lesions infectious; and an
   acute disease with short latent and infectious periods (e.g. 2-3 months)
   and most animals with gross lesions infectious.  The latter appears the
   most likely.
   (6) For both the chronic and acute scenarios and likely combinations of
   disease parameters, the basic reproductive rate for the disease, R0, is
   approximately 1.8-2.0.
   (7) It is suggested that the transmission coefficient for the disease
   (beta) varies inversely with the possum carrying capacity (K),
   explaining why prevalence and disease dynamics vary little with K or the
   habitat.  In simpler Australian habitats, low beta values due to more
   intense spacing behaviour, as well as very much lower K values, may
   explain why Tb is absent from possums.},

Abstract = {The actions of erythromycin lactobionate and porcine motilin on
   trans-sphincteric flow and simultaneous sphincter of Oddi motility were
   studied in 15 anaesthetized Australian Brush-tailed possums (Trichosurus
   vulpecula). Erythromycin (25-200 mug/kg) and motilin (25-200 ng/kg) were
   administered as graded doses by close intraarterial injection.
   Trans-sphincteric flow was measured as inflow and outflow. Both motilin
   and erythromycin decreased trans-sphincteric inflow (both P<0.0001) and
   outflow (P<0.0001 and P = 0.0017 respectively) in a dose-dependent
   manner. The highest dose of each agent abolished trans-sphincteric flow.
   These agents increased sphincter of Oddi phasic contraction frequency
   and basal pressure up to 2 and 3 fold respectively (P<0.05). The
   amplitude of the sphincter of Oddi phasic contractions were not
   influenced in any consistent fashion by either agent. The durations of
   the responses (trans-sphincteric inflow) elicited by erythromycin and
   motilin were dose dependent (P = 0.0225 and P = 0.0001 respectively).
   The actions of erythromycin (200 mug/kg) or motilin (100 ng/kg) on
   trans-sphincteric flow and sphincter of Oddi motility were not
   influenced by neural blockade with tetrodotoxin. These findings support
   the hypothesis that erythromycin acts as a motilin agonist and both
   substances increase the resistance to flow through the sphincter of Oddi
   by raising the basal pressure and frequency of contractions.},

Abstract = {Tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) luteinizing hormone (LH) was purified
   from pituitaries collected from wild and captive populations by salt
   sequential precipitation, ion exchange chromatography and gel
   filtration. Pituitary tissue (5 g) yielded 1.8 mg of purified wallaby
   luteinizing hormone (ME-14B), as verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate

   radioimmunoassay has been developed for measurement of LH in plasma of
   marsupials using a monoclonal antibody raised against bovine LH (518B7).
   This assay system was able to measure basal LH concentrations in male
   and female tammars and detected a significant rise in plasma LH in
   response to oestradiol benzoate in female tammars and luteinizing
   hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) in males. Parallel dose-response curves
   were also obtained from pituitary extracts from four other species of
   marsupial (brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula; brown antechinus,
   Antechinus stuartii; kowari, Dasyuroides byrnei; and Eastern pygmy
   possum, Cercartetus nanus) in this assay, which suggests its usefulness

Abstract = {Possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), originally introduced from Australia,
   are spread over 90\% of New Zealand and cause major economic and
   environmental damage. Immunocontraception has been suggested as a humane
   means to control them. Marsupial-specific reproductive antigens
   expressed at high levels in edible transgenic plant tissue might provide
   a safe, effective, and cheap oral delivery bait for immuno-contraceptive
   control. As proof of concept, female possums vaccinated with
   immunocontraceptive antigens showed reduced fertility, and possums fed
   with potato-expressed heat labile toxin-B (LT-B) had mucosal and
   systemic immune responses to the antigen. This demonstrated that
   immunocontraception was effective in possums and that oral delivery in
   edible plant material might be possible. Nuclear transformation with
   reporter genes showed that transgenic carrot roots accumulate high
   levels of foreign protein in edible tissues, indicating their potential
   as a delivery vector. However, prior to attempts at large scale
   production, more effective immunocontraceptive antigen-adjuvant
   formulations are probably required before plant-based
   immunocontraception can become a major tool for immunocontraceptive
   control of overabundant vertebrate pests. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Formation of cortical granules was examined in superovulated oocytes
   from three marsupial species, brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula)
   tammar wallabies (Macropus eugeniii) and grey short-tailed opossums
   (Monodelphis domestica) and in oocytes obtained during natural cycles in
   Macropus eugenii. Superovulation was induced by pregnant mares' serum
   gonadotrophin/gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (PMSG/GnRH) protocols and
   natural ovulation by removal of pouch young. Oocytes were collected
   after ovariectomy or by laparoscopically guided follicle aspiration into
   Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with either 2.5\% fetal
   calf serum (FCS) or 2.5\% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Ovulated oocytes
   were collected by removing and flushing the oviducts with HBSS and fixed
   immediately for electron microscopy. There were no differences in the
   morphology or timing of formation of cortical granules between
   superovulated and naturally cycling animals. Cortical granules were
   absent from germinal vesicle (GV) stage follicular oocytes before the
   luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in all species. Dark cortical granules,
   similar in appearance to those seen in the oocytes of eutherian mammals,
   were found just beneath the plasma membrane (9 per 100-mu-m of plasma
   membrane) of preovulatory oocytes at germinal vesicle, metaphase 1 or
   anaphase 1 stages. In addition, they contained a number of less
   electron-dense cortical granules (12 per 100-mu-m plasma membrane). The
   cortical cytoplasm of preovulatory oocytes was rich in Golgi complexes
   actively involved in vesicle formation. Large numbers of dark cortical
   granules (90 per 100-mu-m plasma membrane) were found only in ovulated
   oocytes. A small number of cortical granules of lighter electron density
   were also present in ovulated oocytes. This suggests that the marsupial
   oocyte is following a very different timetable for cortical granule
   formation and accumulation from eutherian mammals and that oocytes of
   marsupials may not achieve cytoplasmic maturity until after ovulation.
   The significance of these events for fertilization and development
   remains to be established.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. A model is described for predicting the outcome of biological control
   of New Zealand possums, using viral-vectored immunocontraception based
   on a sexually transmitted herpes-type vector.
   2. The model shows that success is possible in ecological terms, and
   identifies the probable circumstances under which it is achievable.
   These provide targets which a genetically modified virus must meet,
   aiding in the quest for suitable vectors and appropriate genetic
   modifications to them.
   3. In particular, the female reproductive system rather than the male's
   should be targeted, contact rate (i.e. number of potentially infectious
   contacts) per possum carrying the virus (i.e. infected, not infectious)
   must be in the order of one or more per year and at least 75\% of
   females carrying the virus must be sterile at mating. Achieving this
   incidence is critical, with only slightly lower values exerting a
   disproportionately lower effect on possum densities.
   4. Spatial aggregation of the viral vector and the existence of a
   recovered and immune class of possums would both reduce substantially
   the impact of the control agent, but the presence of even limited
   vector-induced mortality would dramatically enhance it.
   5. Immunocontraception is likely to confer a selective advantage on the
   engineered virus by allowing multiple matings for an affected female.
   This will raise the contact rate and prevalence, and allow the vector to
   compete successfully with any existing wild strains.
   6. Given an appropriate mechanism of action on the reproductive system,
   viral-vectored immunocontraception of this kind would, if successful,
   offer a uniquely acceptable control for a vertebrate pest such as the
   possum, being humane, species-specific, cost-effective and
   environmentally benign.
   7. Even if immunocontraception caused only limited suppression of an
   otherwise uncontrolled population, it could contribute to successful
   integrated control by greatly reducing the need for conventional
   poisoning operations. Such integrated control also reduces possum
   densities more rapidly than would occur with immuno-contraception alone.},

Abstract = {Erythromycin has been shown to interact with gastrointestinal smooth
   muscle in a similar manner to motilin, and has been postulated as a
   motilin receptor agonist. We report that in isolated preparations from
   the biliary tract of thirty one Australian Brush-tailed Possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) erythromycin acts in a similar manner to
   motilin. In all muscle strips from the sphincter of Oddi, prepared in
   both the circular and longitudinal orientation, both synthetic porcine
   motilin (10(-10) M-10(-6) M) and erythromycin (lactobionate) (10(-8)
   M-10(-4) M) stimulated contractile activity in a concentration dependant
   manner, via a direct effect on the smooth muscle (the response was
   unaffected by tetrodotoxin, omega conotoxin GVIA or atropine). In strips
   prepared from the gallbladder neither agonist affected the contractile
   activity in 7 of 8 animals.
   Motilin was approximately 1000 fold more potent in stimulating
   contractile activity than erythromycin in both sphincter of Oddi
   circular strips {[}pD2 for peak response to motilin 8.67 (mean) +/- 0.06
   (SEM) compared with erythromycin 5.67 +/- 0.09] and sphincter of Oddi
   longitudinal strips {[}pD2 for peak response to motilin 8.64 (mean) +/-
   0.28 (SEM) compared with erythromycin 5.45 +/- 0.23]. The concentration
   response curves for motilin and erythromycin were similar and both
   agonists required the presence of extracellular calcium to elicit
   responses (responses were diminished by verapamil and abolished in
   calcium free Krebs solution).
   Our results support the hypothesis that erythromycin mimics the action
   of motilin in stimulating the sphincter of Oddi in vitro.},

   was used to assess whether intraspecies transmission between live pigs
   could explain the high levels of infection in the wild population. In
   trial 1, no new infection was detected in 18 penned sentinels after
   total exposure of 3.9 yr (2.6 mo/sentinel); three of 11 sentinels in the
   wild became infected. In trial 2, a more heavily infected source pig
   population (94\% prevalence compared with 42\% in the first trial) was
   used, and one (4\%) of 25 penned sentinels became infected. However,
   75\% of the eight sentinels released to the wild became infected.
   Combining trials, the difference in apparent annual incidence was
   significant (mean+/-95\% confidence interval = 0.03+/-0.12 for penned
   sentinels vs. 1.06+/-6.74 for released sentinels; t=-3.51, P=0.04). In
   the pens, infected pigs were kept in contact with susceptible sentinels
   for 7 yr in total, but only one transmission event was detected. Taking
   pig longevity into account, the R(0) value (the basic reproductive rate
   of disease) for intraspecies infection between live pigs seems unlikely
   to exceed 0.25, even under highly conducive conditions. We suggest that
   live pigs are unlikely to transmit M. bovis to wild conspecifics often
   enough to sustain Tb in pigs by this route of transmission alone. The
   high prevalences seen in some New Zealand feral pig populations are
   likely to result from transmission from another host or route.},

Abstract = {Sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080) is applied as a vertebrate
   pesticide in New Zealand for control of introduced mammalian pests.
   Despite its widespread use, little is known about the soil ecotoxicity
   of 1080. Therefore, the hazard of 1080 to soil invertebrates, plants,
   and soil microorganisms was evaluated in a series of controlled
   laboratory tests. No earthworm (Eisenia fetida) mortality was reported
   with 1080 exposures up to 865 mg/kg soil. The lowest-observable-effect
   concentration and the median effect level for earthworm reproduction
   were 100 and 90 mg/kg soil, respectively, for cocoon production and 100
   and 160 mg/kg soil, respectively, for juvenile production. Lettuce
   (Lactuca sativa) was more sensitive than oats (Avena sativa) to 1080.
   Lettuce seedling emergence and seedling shoot growth were adversely
   affected at a soil concentration of 7 mg/kg. The presence of 1080 in
   soil at concentrations up to 1 g/kg soil did not affect the ability of
   soil microorganisms to mineralize nitrogen. Furthermore, nitrate
   mineralization was not inhibited in soil treated with the urine of
   1080-poisoned possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). The data collectively
   indicate that 1080-related effects on soil organisms occur at levels
   well above those that have been measured in soil (< 0.1 mg/kg) following
   application of 1080 in baits for vertebrate pest control in New Zealand.},

Abstract = {The zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular glycoprotein coat that is
   deposited around the oocyte during folliculogenesis and performs several
   functions that relate to fertilisation and preimplantion development. In
   eutherian mammals it consists of three major glycoproteins - ZPA, ZPB,
   and ZPC - but little is known about its molecular constitution in
   marsupials. We have isolated the cDNA encoding the ZPA homologue in two
   distantly related marsupial series: the possum, Trichosurus vulpecula (a
   phalangerid) and the dunnart Sminthopsis crassicaudata (a dasyurid). The
   two cDNA sequences were 86\% identical and showed extensive regions of
   homology to eutherian ZPA proteins, particularly in the central region
   of the molecule. Many other features of the ZPA protein, except the
   positioning of the N-linked glycosylation sites, were also conserved
   between marsupials and eutherians. ZPA expression was shown to occur
   maximally in the cytoplasm of the oocyte primary follicles with a
   little, but significant, expression in oocytes of both primordial
   follicles and in the cytoplasm of the oocyte in follicles with an antral
   cavity. No expression was seen in surrounding follicle or granulosa

Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-28},
Abstract = {We examined the threat status of the low tree Pittosporum patulum
   throughout its range in eastern South Island, based on plot-based
   sampling of habitat, defoliation by mammalian herbivores, demographic
   and dieback characteristics. Using environmental modelling (Land
   Environments of New Zealand), we found no explanation for the `gap' in
   its disjunct distribution from Nelson-Marlborough-north Canterbury to
   south Canterbury as a component of upper montane Nothofagus forest and
   non-Nothofagus subalpine scrub. Size-classes in some populations suggest
   pulses of recruitment that may be phenologically or disturbance
   engendered, whereas others have demographic evidence for more continuous
   recruitment. In forest, disturbance appears not as important as
   environmental stress in maintaining understorey light gaps that allow it
   to reach reproductive maturity. A range of introduced mammalian
   herbivores appear to defoliate P. patulum, although consistently high
   levels of defoliation on adult foliage above ungulate browse-height
   point to possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) as the main pest. Demographic
   data and herbarium records show adults are few in Nelson-Marlborough and
   north Canterbury, where the species' viability is in question despite
   many juveniles. Alternatively, south Canterbury populations, although
   browsed, show less dieback, especially in subalpine scrub. Its variable
   demography may be related to the history of possum colonisation
   throughout its range. Evidential support is provided for its threat
   ranking of `nationally endangered'.},

Journal = {TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis is the cause of tuberculosis in animals and
   sometimes humans. Many developed nations have long-standing programmes
   to eradicate tuberculosis in livestock, principally cattle. As disease
   prevalence in cattle decreases these efforts are sometimes impeded by
   passage of M.bovis from wildlife to cattle. In epidemiological terms,
   disease can persist in some wildlife species, creating disease
   reservoirs, if the basic reproduction rate (R-0) and critical community
   size (CCS) thresholds are achieved. Recognized wildlife reservoir hosts
   of M.bovis include the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New
   Zealand, European badger (Meles meles) in Great Britain and Ireland,
   African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in South Africa, wild boar (Sus
   scrofa) in the Iberian Peninsula and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) in Michigan, USA. The epidemiological concepts of R-0 and
   CCS are related to more tangible disease/pathogen characteristics such
   as prevalence, pathogen-induced pathology, host behaviour and ecology.
   An understanding of both epidemiological and disease/pathogen
   characteristics is necessary to identify wildlife reservoirs of M.bovis.
   In some cases, there is a single wildlife reservoir host involved in
   transmission of M.bovis to cattle. Complexity increases, however, in
   multihost systems where multiple potential reservoir hosts exist. Bovine
   tuberculosis eradication efforts require elimination of M.bovis
   transmission between wildlife reservoirs and cattle. For successful
   eradication identification of true wildlife reservoirs is critical, as
   disease control efforts are most effective when directed towards true
   reservoirs.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {151-157},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The effects of the prolactin inhibiting drug, cabergoline, on pregnant
   and lactating marsupials were investigated in four species from three
   diverse families: the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, the quokka,
   Setonix brachyurus, the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, and the
   fat-tailed dunnart, Sminthopsis cassicaudata. In tammar wallabies, 20 mu
   g cabergoline kg(-1) injected intramuscularly I day before expected
   birth did not alter the timing of parturition but neonates died within a
   day of birth, suggesting that the onset of lactation was compromised.
   During early lactation in tammars (56-69 days post partum), an
   intramuscular injection transiently retarded growth of the young,
   although they subsequently survived. This treatment induced reactivation
   of the quiescent corpus luteum and the blastocyst from diapause, so a
   new birth occurred 26-27 days later, despite the continued sucking of
   the young in the pouch. Intramuscular injection during late lactation
   (166-199 days post partum) apparently suppressed milk secretion since
   pouch young lost up to 20\% of their bodyweight or died within 7 days of
   treatment. Oral administration of cabergoline had no effect on the
   growth of the young or on the quiescent corpus luteum and diapausing
   blastocyst. Quokkas showed similar responses to tammars after treatment
   in late lactation. Possums and dunnarts were less sensitive to injected
   cabergoline than the two macropodid species, and possums showed no
   response to oral administration. The lack of response of these marsupial
   species to oral cabergoline treatment suggests that accidental ingestion
   of baits, containing 20 mu g cabergoline kg(-1), used to control
   introduced eutherian pests such as the red fox, Vulpes vulpes, or the
   feral cat, Felis cattus, should not affect the reproduction of native
   marsupials.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {617-643},
Abstract = {This brief review summarizes our knowledge of the morphological events
   that are associated with oocyte maturation and fertilization in
   marsupials in which it has been suggested that there are marked
   differences from eutherians in both the developmental timetable of
   oocyte maturation and in some of the processes associated with sperm-egg
   interaction. Most of the data have been obtained from studies on four
   species: Monodelphis domestica, Sminthopsis crassicaudata, Sminthopsis
   macroura, and Trichosurus vulpecula. Differences between the species
   have been described for: (1) the arrangement of `yolk' in the oocyte
   cytoplasm; (2) the time of formation of cortical granules; (3) the mode
   of sperm penetration through the zona pellucida; (4) the sperm membrane
   involved in sperm-egg fusion; (5) the fate of inner acrosomal and sperm
   plasma membranes; and (6) the rapidity of sperm chromatin decondensation
   in the ooplasm. Such differences suggest considerable variation in these
   processes between different marsupial species although some of the
   variation described may be due to technical differences in the obtaining
   of the data. Thus, whether there are fundamental differences between the
   two major extant infraclasses of mammals, marsupials and eutherians, in
   some of the processes associated with fertilization is conjectural at
   the present time. The interspecific variation in the results obtained
   cautions one in extrapolating from observations on one or two `model'
   species to the infraclass as a whole; a conclusion that might not, on
   reflection, be too surprising bearing in mind the long and separate
   evolutionary history of the major extant marsupial lineages.},

   reproductive success},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {158-168},
Abstract = {The kea (Nestor notabilis) and other New Zealand forest birds are
   threatened by predation by introduced mammals. Mammal control for
   biodiversity conservation in New Zealand commonly involves the aerial
   application of cereal-pellet baits containing sodium fluoroacetate (`
   Compound 1080'), but its effectiveness for kea conservation has not
   previously been assessed. This study examined the effects of aerial 1080
   on the reproductive success of kea in a lowland rimu forest on the West
   Coast of New Zealand's South Island. We measured three parameters which
   collectively describe annual reproductive success (nesting frequency,
   nest survival and final chick count), within a
   Before-After-Control-Impact experiment. The Impact site was a 30 000 ha
   area over which 1080 baits were aerially applied in the spring of a rimu
   (Dacrydium cupressinum) mast year (i.e. with heavy seedfall), with the
   After phase of the experiment lasting for two kea nesting seasons. The
   invasive mammals ship rat (Rattus rattus), brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula) and stoat (Mustela erminea), which are potential predators of
   kea nests, were much less abundant in the Impact site after 1080
   application, on the basis of standard indexing techniques. There was
   strong statistical support for an effect of aerial 1080 on kea nest
   survival. Aerial 1080 improved the odds of daily nest survival by a
   factor of 9.1 at the treatment site. Nest survival rates in the Control
   and Impact sites, before the application of 1080, were 21\% and 46.4\%,
   respectively. After the application of 1080 to the Impact site, nest
   survival increased to 84.8\% in this site, whereas it declined to 12.2\%
   in the untreated Control site. This substantial positive effect of
   aerial 1080 on kea nest survival is attributed to the effective control
   of mammalian nest predators, particularly the secondary poisoning of
   stoats.},

Abstract = {We report the first immunocontraceptive trial in mammals using a
   uterine-secreted protein, the marsupial shell coat protein 4 (CP4). The
   marsupial shell coat, which surrounds the conceptus for 60-80\% of
   gestation, is secreted by the uterine epithelium. Following immunization
   against glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CP4, the fertility of female
   common brushtail possums (n=6) was significantly reduced (P=0.000), and
   this reduction in fertility was positively correlated with the maximum
   GST-CP4 humoral immune response (P=0.025). Ultrastructural examination
   of the reproductive tract indicated that the cell-mediated immune
   response against GST-CP4 targeted the shell coat, the shell-free
   conceptus and the uterine glandular epithelium, thus preventing normal
   conceptus development and uterine secretion of shell coat proteins and
   nutrients. These results show that uteri ne-secreted proteins are
   promising immunocontraceptive targets, especially in pest mammal
   species, e.g. possum, rabbit and horse, that have uteri ne-secreted
   additions to embryonic coats, or that have late implantation requiring
   uterine nutrient provisioning from secretions.},

Abstract = {Two molecular forms of GnRH (chicken GnRH II and a second variant) are
   present in the brains of species from all the major vertebrate groups.
   In mammals, two forms are present in metatherian species and
   early-evolved eutherian species, but chicken GnRH II has not been
   identified in more advanced eutherian species. We investigated the
   nature of GnRH molecular forms in several early-evolved mammalian
   species, using high performance liquid chromatography and
   radioimmunoassay with specific GnRH antisera. These chromatographic and
   immunological data indicate that in the brains of a metatherian species
   (possum, Trichosurus vulpecula) and in two early-evolved eutherian
   species (order Insectivora: musk shrew, Suncus murinus and mole,
   Chrysochloris asiatica), both mammalian and chicken II GnRHs are
   present, while in another relatively early-evolved eutherian species
   (order Chiroptera: bat, Miniopterus schreibersii) only mammalian GnRH is
   present. In the adult possum and mole brains the proportion of chicken
   GnRH II was lower than that of mammalian GnRH, while in the musk shrew
   brain chicken GnRH II predominated. A peptide likely to be mammalian
   proGnRH was detected in the brains of the three eutherian species (musk
   shrew, mole, and bat). These findings suggest that metatherian and
   primitive eutherian species of mammals continue to express chicken GnRH
   II as in the vast majority of nonmammalian vertebrates, while the
   peptide is apparently not expressed in modern placental mammalian
   species. The functional significance of chicken GnRH II is not yet
   clear, but there are indications that it has a neurotransmitter or
   neuromodulator role in addition to that of regulating pituitary hormone
   release in certain vertebrate species.},

Abstract = {The brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) zona pellucida (ZP) is
   composed of three major glycoproteins, designated ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3
   based on their size and homology with eutherian ZP proteins. These
   proteins are candidate antigens for the development of an
   immunocontraceptive vaccine to control the fertility of the brushtail
   possum in New Zealand, where it is an introduced pest. In order to
   further their immunological and functional characterization, recombinant
   possum ZP proteins were produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain JM
   109, M 15, SG13009, or BL21 codon plus. Each of the proteins produced
   possessed a N-terminal six histidine tag (His)(6) to facilitate
   purification and consisted of amino acid (aa) residues 18-471 of possum
   ZP1, aa residues 40-311 of ZP2 (ZP2-N), aa residues 305-634 of ZP2
   (ZP2-C), and aa residues 23-342 of ZP3. Immunoblot using
   anti-RGS(His)(4) antibodies and polyclonal rabbit anti-porcine ZP
   antibodies detected major bands at 54 kDa for ZP1, 32 kDa for ZP2-N, 39
   kDa for ZP2-C, and 40 kDa for ZP3. Immunization of male and female
   rabbits with ZP2-N, ZP2-C, and ZP3 purified on Ni-NTA resin under
   denaturing conditions generated antibodies reactive with recombinant ZP
   proteins on Western blot and with native ZP proteins in possum ovarian
   sections using immunofluorescence. Antibodies generated against ZP1 in
   the same way were reactive with recombinant ZP proteins on Western blot
   only. The recombinant possum ZP proteins and specific antibodies
   produced in this study give an indication of the antigenic relationship
   of the possum ZP proteins and are vital tools for future studies of
   sperm-ZP binding in marsupials and for the evaluation of ZP-based
   contraceptive vaccines in possums and other marsupials.},

   period},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-519},
Abstract = {During the period immediately before ovulation, the oocytes of most
   eutherian and marsupial mammals complete the first meiotic maturation
   division and extrude the first polar body. In marsupials, this phase of
   nuclear maturation is accompanied by an increase in size of the egg and
   maturation of cytoplasmic components. Oocytes from at least four
   marsupial species, Trichosurus vulpecula, Macropus eugenii, Bettongia
   penicillata and Monodelphis domestica, continue to grow after formation
   of the follicular antrum and, although the rate of growth slows in
   larger follicles, it continues into the period immediately before
   ovulation. The basis of this growth is unknown but may include
   accumulation of fluid and/or yolk-like material. Maturational changes
   within the cytoplasm of the oocyte also occur during the periovulatory
   period, including the accumulation of cortical granules. Differences in
   the structure of the zona pellucida are also evident between follicular
   and ovulated eggs; these differences are suggestive of compression of
   the zona pellucida, but may involve the addition of extra material.
   These findings suggest that the marsupial oocyte may not achieve
   complete cytoplasmic maturity until after ovulation; however, their
   relevance to fertilization and embryonic development require further
   investigation. Like those of eutherian mammals, marsupial oocytes
   undergo spontaneous nuclear maturation once removed from the follicular
   environment, suggesting a basically similar control system. It is not
   known whether the preovulatory cytoplasmic changes seen in marsupial
   oocytes matured in vivo also occur during maturation in vitro.},

Journal = {GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {17},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The newly sequenced genome of Monodelphis domestica not only provides
   the out-group necessary to better understand our own eutherian lineage,
   but it enables insights into the innovative biology of metatherians.
   Here, we compare Monodelphis with Homo sequences from alignments of
   single nucleotides, genes, and whole chromosomes. Using PhyOP, we have
   established orthologs in Homo for 82\% (15,250) of Monodelphis gene
   predictions. Those with single orthologs in each species exhibited a
   high median synonymous substitution rate (d(S) = 1.02), thereby
   explaining the relative paucity of aligned regions outside of coding
   sequences. Orthology assignments were used to construct a synteny map
   that illustrates the considerable fragmentation of Monodelphis and Homo
   karyotypes since their therian last common ancestor. Fifteen percent of
   Monodelphis genes are predicted, from their low divergence at synonymous
   sites, to have been duplicated in the metatherian lineage. The majority
   of Monodelphis-specific genes possess predicted roles in chemosensation,
   reproduction, adaptation to specific diets, and immunity. Using
   alignments of Monodelphis genes to sequences from either Homo or
   Trichosurus vulpecula (an Australian marsupial), we show that
   metatherian X chromosomes have elevated silent substitution rates and
   high G+C contents in comparison with both metatherian autosomes and
   eutherian chromosomes. Each of these elevations is also a feature of
   subtelomeric chromosomal regions. We attribute these observations to
   high rates of female-specific recombination near the chromosomal ends
   and within the X chromosome, which act to sustain or increase G+C levels
   by biased gene conversion. In particular, we propose that the higher G+C
   content of the Monodelphis X chromosome is a direct consequence of its
   small size relative to the giant autosomes.},

Title = {A TEST OF THE VEGETATION MOSAIC HYPOTHESIS - A HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN THE

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The vegetation mosaic hypothesis suggests that medium-sized mammals
   occupying arid and semi-arid areas of Australia require a habitat that
   is a fine-grained mosaic of different vegetation type-s or seral stages.
   This mosaic is believed to have been created in the spinifex deserts of
   central Australia by Aboriginal burning practices.  Its loss in the
   period 1940-1960 is postulated to be a primary reason for both major
   reductions in range and mainland extinctions of many species of
   medium-sized mammals at this time This study measured the responses of
   three species of medium-sized mammals to vegetation patterns within
   spinifex grasslands that ranged from comparatively uniform to highly
   diverse The abundance, condition, and reproductive status of golden
   bandicoots (Isoodon auratus), northern brush-tailed possums (Trichosurus
   vulpecula arnhemensis), and burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur) were
   assessed within vegetation mosaics of various scales on Barrow Island,
   off the northwest coast of Australia Scale of mosaic proved to have no
   significant effect on the numbers, condition, or reproductive status of
   any of the three species. Similarly, the creation of fine-grained
   mosaics of early seral-stage vegetation mixed within climax vegetation
   by extensive oil-field operations over nearly half the island bad no
   significant effect on the number or condition of animals. Hence scale of
   mosaic seems unlikely to be related to the mainland decline or
   extinction of these species. The pattern of decline and extinction on
   the mainland but continued survival on offshore islands is more
   consistent with the presence (mainland) or absence (islands) of
   introduced predators (foxes and cats) and herbivores (rabbits and
   stock).},

Title = {SEED DISPERSAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN CYCAD <i>MACROZAMIA MIQUELII</i>
   (ZAMIACEAE): ARE CYCADS MEGAFAUNA-DISPERSED ``GROVE FORMING{''} PLANTS?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {100},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1127-1136},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Premise of the Study: Plants that invest in large, heavy seeds and
   colorful, fleshy fruits or analogous structures seem adapted for
   dispersal by large vertebrates. Some such plants, like Australian cycads
   in the genus Macrozamia, do not disperse well, which could be explained
   by seed-dispersal relationships with megafauna that are rare or extinct
   in contemporary ecosystems. Such plants provide an opportunity to
   investigate the ecological consequences of low seed-dispersal distances.
   Methods: We investigated seed dispersal of Macrozamia miquelii in
   Central Queensland by tracking the fate of marked seeds, identifying the
   dispersal fauna and quantifying population demography and spatial
   structure.
   Key Results: We found that 70-100\% of marked seeds remained within 1 m
   of maternal females (cycads are dioecious). Of the 812 seeds recovered
   (from 840 originally marked) only 24 dispersed >1 m from maternal
   females, the greatest observed dispersal being 5 m. We found an average
   of 2.2 seedlings and 0.7 juveniles within 1.5 m of mature females, which
   suggests that most seeds that remain in the vicinity of maternal females
   perish. Within-stand densities ranged between 1000 and 5000 plants/ha.
   The brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula was the only animal observed
   to move the seeds.
   Conclusions: Macrozamia are adapted for dispersal by megafauna that are
   rare or absent in contemporary ecosystems. We argue that Macrozamia are
   ``grove forming{''} plants that derive ecological benefit from existing
   as high-density, spatially discrete populations, the function of
   megafaunal dispersal adaptations being the infrequent dispersal of seeds
   en masse to establish new such groves in the landscape.},

Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (GnRH-Rs) expressed in the
   pituitary of eutherian species of mammal are unique in lacking the
   cytoplasmic C-terminal tail characteristic of GnRH-Rs of nonmammalian
   vertebrates and other G protein-coupled receptors. To further
   investigate evolutionary relationships among vertebrate GnRH-Rs, a
   full-coding region cDNA of the pituitary GnRH-R was cloned from a
   metatherian marsupial mammal, the Australian brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula). We have determined the pharmacological
   characteristics and internalization kinetics of this GnRH-R from an
   early evolved, metatherian species of mammal and compared it with the
   corresponding receptors in eutherian species of mammal and nonmammalian
   vertebrates. The predicted GnRH-R protein from the possum pituitary has
   high homology with the other mammalian GnRH-Rs (80\% identity) and, in
   common with other mammals, lacks an intracellular C-terminal tail. The
   ligand selectivity of the possum GnRH-R transfected into COS-1 cells,
   assessed using inositol phosphate assays and radioreceptor binding
   assays, was similar to that of the other mammalian GnRH-Rs, and distinct
   from those of the nonmammalian GnRH-Rs, The pharmacological
   characteristics of the possum GnRH-R were similar to those of other
   mammalian GnRH-Rs, for a selection of agonists (including naturally
   occurring GnRH ligands and super-agonists) and antagonists,
   Receptor-mediated internalization of GnRH agonist by the possum GnRH-R
   was slightly more rapid than that of the human GnRH-R, while the
   internalization kinetics of the chicken GnRH-R, in which a cytoplasmic
   C-terminal tail is present, was considerably more rapid, In terms of the
   evolution of the GnRH-R in vertebrates, the possum (a metatherian
   mammal) GnRH-R has a striking resemblance, in both structure and
   pharmacological characteristics, to GnRH-Rs in eutherian mammals, which
   are quite distinct from the nonmammalian vertebrate GnRH-Rs, and are
   unique among G protein-coupled receptors in lacking an intracellular
   C-terminal tail. The distinct structure of the pituitary GnRH-R in
   mammalian vertebrates is likely to have important functional
   consequences in the reproductive physiology of mammals. (C) 2000

   procedures also provide means to enhance conservation of endangered
   species. Such procedures are examined in the stripe-faced dunnart, an
   excellent model for developmental analysis, and the common brush-tail
   possum, an agricultural and ecological pest species in New Zealand that
   has become a model for fertility control in marsupials. A long-term
   colony of the stripe-faced dunnart has been in existence for 21 years,
   and the procedures for its maintenance and continued survival are
   outlined, and include minimal reproductive contributions from
   wild-caught animals, and development of an appropriate timetable of
   development and induced-ovulation protocols. Common brushtail possum
   colonies are relatively frequent but have regular input from wild-caught
   animals. Procedures that minimise competition for prized resources and
   allow successful group housing of possums are outlined. For both species
   the available development timetables, in vitro techniques and induced
   ovulation protocols are essential tools for the study of developmental
   mechanisms and fertility control, respectively, and also have
   considerable implications for conservation of these and other species.},

Title = {CONTROL OF ENDEMIC BOVINE TB IN NEW-ZEALAND POSSUM POPULATIONS - RESULTS
   FROM A SIMPLE-MODEL},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {794-809},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {(1) Detailed formulae, and approximate ones based on disease
   reproductive rates, are derived for the rates of harvesting,
   sterilization and vaccination required to eliminate Tb from a possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) population, assuming either density-dependent
   recruitment or density-dependent mortality, asymmetric population growth
   and pseudo-vertical disease transmission.
   (2) The threshold density of susceptible possums for disease elimination
   is about half the uncontrolled population density, achieved by
   harvesting or sterilizing an annual proportion of the population
   approximately equal to r (0.2-0.3) or immunizing an approximate annual
   proportion 3r/2.  The required immunization rate for disease elimination
   is highly sensitive to the nature of host density dependence.
   (3) Simulation of realistic control policies over time, and including
   the costs of implementation, suggests that the most cost-effective
   options currently available are widespread poisoning with 1080 every 6
   years, a single intensive poisoning operation followed by less intense
   ground control, or a poisoning operation followed by subsidized and
   carefully targeted trapping effort.
   (4) Controlled areas must be large (> 50 km2) to prevent breakdown of
   control through immigration from surrounding diseased populations.  Such
   immigration may preclude the possibility of total disease eradication in
   many areas but not its reduction to extremely low levels, given
   indefinitely repeated control.
   (5) The model suggests the need for research into control of
   reproduction, preferably using microbiological agents, as the best
   option for longer-term management both of the disease and of the possum
   as a pest of New Zealand's native forests.
   (6) The results of the model form the basis for current control
   policies, already implemented in response to an urgent need.  At the
   same time specific recommended regimes are being rigorously tested in
   the field.},

Title = {Estimates of maximum annual population growth rates
   (<i>r</i><sub>m</sub>) of mammals and their application in wildlife
   management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {507-514},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {P>1. The maximum annual population growth rate (r(m)) is a critical
   parameter in many models of wildlife dynamics and management. An
   important application of r(m) is the estimation of the maximum
   proportion of a population that can be removed to stop population growth
   (p).
   2. When r(m) cannot be estimated in the field, one option is to estimate
   it from demographic data. We evaluate the use of the relationship
   between r(m) and female age at first reproduction (alpha), which is
   independent of phylogeny, to estimate r(m). We first demonstrate that
   the relationship between field and demographic estimates of r(m) is
   unbiased. We then show that the relationship provides an unbiased and
   simple method to estimate r(m) using data for 64 mammal species. We also
   show that p declines exponentially as alpha increases.
   3. We use the fitted relationship to estimate annual r(m) and p for 55
   mammal species in Australia and New Zealand for which there are no field
   estimates of r(m). The estimates differ by species but have low
   precision (wide 95\% credible intervals CIs). Our estimate of r(m) for
   the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii is high (0 center dot 6, 95\%
   CI: 0 center dot 05-2 center dot 39) and suggests devils would become
   extinct if > 0 center dot 34 of the population is removed annually (e.g.
   by facial tumour disease). Our estimate of r(m) (0 center dot 77, 95\%
   CI: 0 center dot 71-1 center dot 05) for brushtail possum Trichosurus
   vulpecula is much greater than published estimates and highlights the
   need for further field estimates of r(m) for the species in New Zealand.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Since r(m) has not been estimated in the
   field for the majority of mammal species, our approach enables estimates
   with credible intervals for this important parameter to be obtained for
   any species for which female age at first reproduction is known.
   However, the estimates have wide 95\% CIs. The estimated r(m,) and
   associated uncertainty can then be used in population and management
   models, perhaps most importantly to estimate the proportion that if
   removed annually would drive the population to extinction. Our approach
   can be used for taxa other than mammals.},

Abstract = {Cabergoline (CAB) is a potent dopamine agonist and an inhibitor of
   prolactin (PRL). In red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), a single oral dose of 100
   mug kg(-1) CAB can cause abortions and postnatal cub mortality from at
   least Day 21 of the 52-day pregnancy. The abortifacient activity of CAB
   is owing to the suppression of PRL, which is essential for luteotrophic
   support in some eutherian species. Postnatal cub mortality probably
   results from a reduction in the development of the mammary ductile
   system, which is also partially dependant on PRL during pregnancy. This
   paper investigates the potential risks faced by non-target mammalian
   species that may consume CAB baits intended for fox control. Baiting
   with CAB is proposed from 1 August until 1 October each yearn to
   correspond with the time that most vixens are pregnant in south-eastern
   Australia. Thirty-four endemic mammals in south-eastern Australia (9
   eutherians and 25 marsupials) are considered to be potentially
   bait-consuming (PBC) species. The percentage overlap of pregnancy and
   birth periods for each PBC species was compared with the duration of the
   proposed CAB baiting period. Only Antechinus (3 species) and Sminthopsis
   leucopus have greater than 40\% overlap, whereas overlap in endemic
   rodents ranges from 0\% to 22\%. Overall, most PBC rodent populations
   appear to face little risk from CAB baiting, as their period of
   pregnancy does not overlap significantly with the proposed CAB baiting
   period. The Antechinus species, Phascogale tapoatafa and Dasyurus
   maculatus, are the only PBC mammals that are seasonally mono-oestrous
   and are thus probably more susceptible to disruption of breeding
   compared with polyoestrous species that may breed many times a year. At
   a baiting density of 8 baits km(-2), theoretical bait availability for
   small dasyurids, rodents and peramelids is low. This suggests a low
   potential for affecting these populations if CAB was indiscriminate in
   affecting reproductive success in all mammal groups. Presently, studies
   in a limited range of marsupials suggest that, unlike eutherians, the
   marsupial corpus luteum is independent of pituitary control and thus
   suppression of PRL is not likely to cause abortions in marsupials. As
   yet, CAB has not been shown to be orally active in any PBC species other
   than rodents and carnivores. Oral doses of CAB given post partum have
   not been found to affect lactation in Sminthopsis crassicaudata,
   Trichosurus vulpecula, Macropus eugenii and Setonix brachyurus. Further
   studies are required in order to assess the potential for high doses of
   oral CAB to affect pre-partum mammary development and early lactation
   post partum, especially in peramelids and larger dasyurids. Highly
   target-specific baiting techniques, may eliminate most PBC species from
   being exposed to CAB and these are briefly discussed.},

Pages = {419-425},
Abstract = {Luteinizing hormone (LH) was purified from brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula) pituitary glands. The purification procedure consisted of
   ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by triazinyl-dye chromatography,
   hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration. A yield of 10
   mu g LH g(-1) pituitary with a recovery of 20\% was obtained from 1400
   pituitary glands (20.3 g). Contamination with possum
   follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was less than or equal to 0.05\%. The
   amino acid analysis and the N-terminal sequencing for 10 cycles revealed
   close homology with LH from other mammals. Minor amounts of LH that had
   been truncated near the N-terminal were also detected. No contaminating
   proteins were found by amino acid sequencing. The potency of possum LH
   was 20\% that of ovine LH in a receptor assay using possum testicular
   receptors and 4\% that of ovine LH when bovine corpora lutea receptors
   were used. Possum LH was able to stimulate production of cyclic
   adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate by bovine granulosa cells. A
   radioimmunoassay (RIA) for possum LH using I-125-possum LH and an
   antiserum raised against ovine LH was developed. The RIA has a
   sensitivity of 0.15 ng mL(-1), a 50\% displacement of 1.9 ng mL(-1) and
   a cross-reactivity of <0.02\% against possum FSH. Plasma concentrations
   were 0.24+/-0.04 ng mL(-1) (n = 8) and 0.39+/-0.12 ng mL(-1) (n = 8) in
   female and male possums respectively. Administration of mammalian
   gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and chicken GnRH II stimulated
   increases in plasma LH concentrations in male and female possums. When
   comparing LH responses with administration of mammalian GnRH or chicken
   GnRH II, plasma LH concentrations remained elevated for a longer period
   of time in males than in females (P < 0.01); plasma LH concentrations
   also remained elevated for longer after mammalian GnRH than after
   chicken GnRH II (P < 0.01). Gonadectomy stimulated an increase in plasma
   concentrations of LH in both male (P < 0.01) and female (P < 0.05)
   possums. The rate of increase in plasma LH concentrations in males was
   faster than that in females. In summary, we have purified, partially
   characterized, and developed a RIA for possum LH.},

   was fixed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and
   the contralateral side was used for the determination of sperm number,
   distribution and motility. Sperm form was similar between the two
   species. Approximately 56 x 10(6) testicular sperm and 100 x 10(6)
   epididymal sperm per side were present in I. macrourus, about 60\% of
   which were in the caudal region. Initiation of sperm nuclear rotation
   and loss of the cytoplasmic droplet was first observed in distal caput
   or proximal corpus segments along with slow progressive motility. In
   these sperm, dislocation and anterior movement of the sperm neck from
   the implantation fossa and the modification of the distal margins of the
   sperm acrosome were evident. Motility of cauda epididymidal spermatozoa
   was rapid and coordinated, movement was restricted to one plane, and
   lateral head displacement was marked. As media viscosity increased,
   sperm velocity decreased, as did the amplitude of the tail beat, its
   frequency, and lateral head displacement but, in viscous mineral oil and
   mixtures of media and prostatic exudate, extremely rapid sinusoidal
   motility occurred. This study has detailed unusual morphological changes
   in bandicoot sperm during epididymal maturation and has shown that,
   although bandicoot sperm differ morphologically from those of the
   dasyurids, particularly in relation to head-tail orientation and tail
   ultrastructure, they exhibit similar motility.},

Abstract = {Most mammals exhibit seasonal variation in the reproductive capacity of
   one or both sexes. While the female southern hairy-nosed wombat
   Lasiorhinus latifrons is a known seasonal breeder, the extent of
   seasonality in the male has not been documented. To examine this, gross
   body measurements including scrotal diameter and the dimensions of the
   accessory gland bulge were recorded and male reproductive tracts were
   examined between 1993 and 2000. Testes, epididymides and accessory
   glands from all males were dissected free of connective tissue and
   weighed. In addition, matched semen samples were collected over four
   time points in 2000 corresponding to the breeding season (September),
   immediately post-breeding season (November), during the non-breeding
   season (January), and immediately before the onset of the next breeding
   season (June) as determined from female reproductive status. Semen was
   collected by electro-ejaculation and analysed for volume, sperm number
   and motility characteristics. Ejaculate volume, total ejaculate sperm
   number, percentage motile sperm, and the sperm motility rating and index
   were all significantly elevated in September and significantly lower in
   November and January. This correlated with a significant increase in
   body weight, peri-cloacal gland width, and the weights of the prostate,
   Cowper's glands, urethral bulb and crus penis. The data confirm that
   male reproduction in the southern hairy-nosed wombat, like that of the
   female, is highly seasonal with a peak in reproductive capacity
   occurring in August-September and a reduction by November.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {121-130},
Abstract = {The potential effects of predation risk on common brushtail possums were
   investigated in south-eastern Australian woodlands. Patterns of habitat
   use, foraging costs using giving-up density (GUD) experiments, and
   indices of body condition and reproductive success were examined at
   eight sites in two habitat types (eucalypt- or cypress-pine-dominated
   stands), within three areas of different red fox abundance ( high,
   moderate and low fox density). In cypress-pine-dominated stands, possums
   travelled further on the ground, visited more feeding stations and had
   lower GUDs at feeders where foxes were removed than did possums in
   high-fox-density sites. In contrast, there was no effect of fox removal
   on the behaviour of possums in eucalypt-dominated stands. Fox removal
   also had no effect on indices of body condition and reproduction. Minor
   effects of microhabitat were detected with trackplot and GUD
   experiments, but, overall, the results suggest that habitat at the
   stand-level was more important. The nonlethal effects of foxes in
   different habitats may need to be taken into account when developing
   conservation strategies for native marsupials.},

Abstract = {Sperm-oviduct interactions in Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus
   rufogriseus) were investigated using in vitro cocultures of cauda
   epididymal spermatozoa and oviducal epithelial cells. Kidney epithelial
   cells were used as non-reproductive control tissues. Spermatozoa
   attached to epithelial cells of both origins, but sperm survival and
   activity was higher when cocultured with oviducal cells. New findings
   during live sperm-epithelial interactions included: (1) a high frequency
   of reversible head movements, from linear (streamlined configuration) to
   T shape (thumbtack configuration) in swimming spermatozoa immediately
   after the start of coculture; (2) the loss of sperm tails (tail
   shedding) increasing with time; and (3) interrupted swimming patterns,
   where periods of fast movement were interspersed with slower swimming
   while the spermatozoa interacted with the epithelial cell surface. Sperm
   motility activation responses were characterised after diluting the
   epididymal samples in phosphate-buffered saline, medium M199 and
   Tyrode's medium. The results confirmed that the marsupial oviduct is
   able to support the viability and motility of a sperm subpopulation for
   at least 20 h in vitro and suggest that some spermatozoa shed their
   tails after binding, possibly as a result of a selective process.},

Abstract = {The marsupial conceptus is surrounded by a uteri ne-secreted shell coat
   for 60-80\% of gestation. Coat protein 4 (CP4) is the only marsupial
   shell coat protein characterized and it has only been identified in one
   species, the Common Brushtail Possum. In this possum, uterine
   transcription and secretion of cp4 during the oestrous cycle is biphasic
   and associated with the stage of conceptus development. Here we cloned
   cp4 (sm-cp4) from a distantly related species, the Stripe-faced Dunnart
   (Sminthopsis macroura). Transcription of sm-cp4 and secretion of smCP4
   were identified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry,
   respectively. The effect of reproductive hormones on sm-cp4
   transcription was investigated in vitro by treatment of uterine explant
   cultures with oestrogen and/or progesterone. In vivo uterine, expression
   of smCP4 was biphasic and associated with conceptus development. Uterine
   smCP4 expression (transcription and secretion) began during the
   pre-ovulatory period and continued post-ovulation during cleavage
   stages. Transcription of sm-cp4 continued during the unilaminar
   blastocyst stage, but smCP4 secretion was reduced during this stage.
   During the bilaminar blastocyst stage, both transcription of sm-cp4 and
   secretion of smCP4 were low before they both resumed during the
   trilaminar blastocyst stage, and continued during the embryo and fetal
   stages. In vitro uterine transcription of sm-cp4 increased after
   incubation with progesterone.},

Title = {Urban environments alter parasite fauna, weight and reproductive
   activity in the quenda (<i>Isoodon obesulus</i>)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {607},
Pages = {1466-1478},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Some wildlife species are capable of surviving in urbanised
   environments. However, the implications of urbanisation on wildlife
   health, and public health regarding zoonoses, are often unknown. Quenda
   (syn. southern brown bandicoots, Isoodon obesulus) survive in many areas
   of Perth, Australia, despite urbanisation. This study investigated
   differences in gastrointestinal and macroscopic ecto-parasitic
   infections, morphometrics and reproductive status between bushland and
   urban dwelling quenda. 287 quenda in the greater Perth region were
   captured and sampled for faeces (to detect gastrointestinal parasites),
   blood (to detect Toxoplasma gondii antibodies), ectoparasites, and
   morphometrics. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic and
   linear regression. Most parasitic infections identified in quenda were
   of native parasite taxa that are either not known to, or considered
   highly unlikely to, infect humans or domestic animals. However, stick
   fast fleas (Echidnophaga spp.) were present at low prevalences and
   intensities, and Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Amblyomma spp.
   infections require further investigation to clarify their
   anthropozoonotic significance. Quenda captured in urbanised environments
   had differing odds of or intensity of certain parasitic infections,
   compared to those in bushland - likely attributable to quenda population
   density, and in some cases the availability of other host species or
   anthropogenic sources of infection. Urbanised environments were
   associated with an increase in net weight of adult male quenda by 189.0
   g (95\% CI 68.6-309.5 g; p = 0.002; adjusted R-2 = 0.06) and adult
   female quenda by 140.1 g (95\% CI 3.9-276.3 g; p = 0.044; adjusted R-2 =
   0.07), with study findings suggesting a tendency towards obesity in
   urbanised environments. Adult female quenda in bushland had increased
   odds of an active pouch (adjusted OR = 4.89, 95\% CI 1.7-14.5),
   suggesting decreased reproductive activity in quenda from urbanised
   environments. These results highlight the subtle, yet extensive impacts
   that urbanised environments may have on wildlife ecology, even for those
   species which apparently adjust well to urbanisation. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {A variety of media were compared for their ability to sustain the
   motility of tammar wallaby spermatozoa over an 8-h period following
   swim-up from coagulated semen. The study demonstrated that a modified
   Tyrode's solution, Biggers, Whitter and Whittingham medium (BWW) was
   significantly better than any of the other assessed media in supporting
   wallaby sperm motility. After 8 h of incubation in BWW, motility was
   maintained at 79.3 +/- 9.3\%, with 77.0 +/- 10.4\% rapid and 65.7 +/-
   8.7\% progressively motile spermatozoa. By contrast, motility was <10\%
   at the same 8-h time point in all of the other media assessed. After 2 h
   of incubation in BWW, tammar spermatozoa consumed more oxygen than their
   counterparts in PBS (52.0 +/- 2.7 vs 75.0 +/- 6.6 mu L per 10(8)
   spermatozoa per 2 h; P < 0.001). Motility was not enhanced in any of
   these media by the addition of 5 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, the major
   energy substrate in wallaby semen. However, addition of dibutyryl cAMP
   and pentoxifylline in BWW resulted in the extremely rapid induction of
   hyperactivated motility in the entire sperm population. This burst of
   hyperactivated motility was entirely dependent on calcium in BWW and
   significantly inhibited by calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor. A set
   of computer-assisted sperm analysis parameters were identified that
   permitted the accurate quantification of hyperactivation rates in this
   species. This is the first comparative analysis of media for harvesting
   and incubating marsupial spermatozoa and the first record of
   hyperactivated motility in any marsupial species.},

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to identify potential molecular markers of
   acrosomal biogenesis and post-testicular maturation in marsupials, using
   the tammar wallaby as a model species. A two-step sperm extraction
   procedure yielded two protein extracts of apparent acrosomal origin and
   a tail extract. The extracts were analysed by SDS-PAGE under reducing
   conditions. Several prominent polypeptide bands (45, 38 and 33 kDa)
   appeared common to both acrosomal extracts. Antiserum raised against the
   33 kDa polypeptide from the inner acrosomal membrane matrix (IAMM)
   extract showed immunoreactivity with 45, 38 and 33 kDa polypeptides in
   both acrosomal extracts, indicating that the 33 kDa polypeptide was
   related to the proteins in the 45 and 38 kDa bands. Therefore, the
   antiserum was used as a molecular probe. Indirect immunofluorescence
   indicated that the acrosome was the major location of the 33 kDa
   polypeptide. This contention was confirmed by ultrastructural study:
   immunogold labelling indicated that the 33 kDa polypeptide associated
   with acrosomal matrix components throughout acrosomal development in the
   testes and throughout posttesticular maturation in the epididymis. The
   label clearly delineated the changing morphology of the maturing
   marsupial acrosome. This is the first study to use immunocytochemical
   techniques to chart testicular and post-testicular development of any
   sperm organelle in a marsupial. As a result of this study, a 33 kDa
   molecular marker of marsupial acrosome differentiation and maturation
   has been identified. It may be possible to chart similar events in other
   marsupial species and identify opportunities for manipulating fertility.},

Title = {Tracing sperm acrosome differentiation in the testis and maturation in
   the epididymis of the tammar wallaby (<i>Macropus eugenii</i>) with a
   45-kDa acrosome-membrane-associated protein},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {69-77},
Abstract = {A 45-kDa protein was originally extracted from a depression, where the
   acrosome is lodged, on the anterior end of the sperm nucleus of
   ejaculated wallaby spermatozoa. Using immunofluorescent and confocal
   microscopes, this study demonstrates that the 45-kDa protein is
   persistently localized to the sperm acrosome throughout the periods of
   spermiogenesis, spermiation, epididymal maturation and ejaculation in
   the tammar wallaby. The distribution of the 45-kDa protein is always on
   the perimeter of the acrosome and associated with the acrosomal
   membrane, so that changes in the shape of the 45-kDa immunofluorescent
   labelling mirror changes in the shape of the acrosome during its
   differentiation in the testis and epididymis. Thus, the 45-kDa protein
   may be used as a molecular marker to study the marsupial acrosome
   differentiation and to chart the events of testicular and epididymal
   maturation of the spermatozoa. Furthermore, the behaviour of the 45-kDa
   protein during the immunostaining process suggests that this protein is
   a largely insoluble and detergent-resistant protein and may play an
   important role in attachment of the acrosome to the nucleus during sperm
   formation, similar to those inner acrosomal-membrane-associated proteins
   that have been reported in eutherian spermatozoa.},

Title = {Optimal physicochemical conditions for the manipulation and short-term

Abstract = {Protocols for the successful manipulation and preservation of semen in a
   given species depend upon a fundamental knowledge of how spermatozoa
   respond to the physicochemical conditions of the extension media;
   methods developed for the preservation of eutherian spermatozoa may not
   necessarily be suitable for marsupial semen. The aim of this study was
   to investigate the effects on koala sperm motility of serial dilution,
   changes in temperature, diluent pH and osmolality to establish the
   optimal physicochemical conditions for short-term semen storage. This
   study showed that electroejaculated koala semen diluted 1:1 (v/v) with
   PBS frequently coagulated after incubation at 35 degrees C, but that
   further dilution and incubation resulted in a corresponding increase in
   the percentage of spermatozoa swimming in a non-linear trajectory. The
   effect of rapid temperature change on the motility of koala spermatozoa
   was investigated by exposing semen, initially diluted at 35 degrees C,
   to temperatures of 45, 25, 15 and 5 degrees C. Although sperm motility
   was reduced after incubation at 45 degrees C, a rapid decrease in
   temperature of up to 20 degrees C did not result in a significant
   reduction in sperm motility. However, contrary to evidence in other
   marsupials, there was a small but significant decrease in sperm motility
   after rapid cooling of diluted semen from 35 to 5 degrees C. The effects
   of diluent pH and osmolality on the motility of koala spermatozoa were
   investigated. These experiments indicated that diluents for koala sperm
   manipulation should buffer in a pH range of 7-8 and have an osmolality
   of approximately 300 mmol kg(-1). The final experiment compared the
   relative effectiveness of Tris-citrate buffer (1\% glucose) and PBS to
   maintain koala sperm motility over a range of incubation temperatures
   (5-35 degrees C) for up to 8 days. Reduction in sperm motility was
   directly related to temperature, and motility was sustained for the
   longest duration when stored at 5 degrees C. The Tris-citrate buffer
   solution was superior to PBS as a preservation diluent at all
   temperatures, and koala spermatozoa remained motile even after 42 days
   storage at 5 degrees C. Spermatozoa diluted in PBS (with Ca2+ or Mg2+)
   and cooled to 5 degrees C showed evidence of an unusual motility
   pattern, similar to that of hyperactivated eutherian spermatozoa. This
   study showed that koala spermatozoa respond to different physicochemical
   conditions associated with short-term liquid storage in essentially the
   same way as the spermatozoa of eutherian mammals, although koala
   spermatozoa appear to be more tolerant of rapid temperature shock. The
   results of this study can be used to make informed selections with
   regard to appropriate diluent composition and improved short-term sperm
   preservation protocols and represent the first such database for any
   species of marsupial.},

Abstract = {The family Arteriviridae presently includes a single genus Arterivirus.
   This genus includes four species as the taxonomic homes for equine
   arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV),
   porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian
   hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), respectively. A revision of this
   classification is urgently needed to accommodate the recent description
   of eleven highly divergent simian arteriviruses in diverse African
   nonhuman primates, one novel arterivirus in an African forest giant
   pouched rat, and a novel arterivirus in common brushtails in New
   Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is not in
   accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of
   Virus Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated,
   amended, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data.
   Taxon-specific sequence cut-offs are established relying on a newly
   established open reading frame 1b phylogeny and pairwise sequence
   comparison (PASC) of coding-complete arterivirus genomes. As a result,
   the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus
   (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDV + PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFV + simian
   arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the arterivirus from forest giant
   pouched rats), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The
   current species Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is
   divided into two species to accommodate the clear divergence of the
   European and American ``types{''} of PRRSV, both of which now receive
   virus status. The current species Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is
   divided into nine species to accommodate the twelve known simian
   arteriviruses. Non-Latinized binomial species names are introduced to
   replace all current species names to clearly differentiate them from
   virus names, which remain largely unchanged.},

Abstract = {Timing of artificial insemination (AI) in marsupials is critical because
   fertilization must occur before mucin coats the oocyte during passage
   through the oviduct. In this study, timing and the site of insemination
   were examined to develop AI in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii).
   Birth and postpartum (p.p.) estrus was synchronized in 46 females.
   Epididymal spermatozoa (n = 4) or semen collected by electroejaculation
   (n = 42) were inseminated early (4-21 h p.p.) into the urogenital sinus
   (n = 7), the anterior vaginal culs de sac (n = 7), the uterus by
   transcervical catheter (n = 5), or the uterus by injection (intrauterine
   artificial insemination, IUAI) (n = 5). A further 16 females were
   inseminated late (19-48 h p.p.) by IUAI. All females were monitored for
   birth. A third group of six females was inseminated late (21-54 h p.p.)
   by IUAI and 0.4-6.6 h later, sperm had reached the oviduct in all
   animals. In total, an oocyte to which spermatozoa were attached was
   recovered and two young were born after IUAI using epididymal (n = 1) or
   electroejaculated (n = 2) spermatozoa, but no young resulted from
   insemination at other sites. Two females were successfully inseminated
   at 43 and 47 h p.p., later than most other animals, and the third was
   inseminated much earlier (18 h p.p.) but with highly motile spermatozoa.
   These young represent the first macropodids born by AI and the first
   marsupials conceived using epididymal spermatozoa.},

Abstract = {Effective sperm cryopreservation protocols are limited to a small number
   of marsupial species. In this study, postmortem gamete rescue (PMGR)
   epididymal sperm samples from Tasmanian devils (N = 34) euthanized due
   to the fatal Devil Facial Tumor Disease were used to develop long-term
   sperm storage techniques for the species. Cryoprotectant toxicity
   associated with equilibration of sperm samples in a TEST yolk diluent
   (TEST; 189 mM N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 85
   mM Trizma base {[}Tris] 11 mM glucose, 20\% vol/vol egg yolk; pH 7.1,
   and 315.0 +/- 5.0 mOsm/kg) with a final concentration of 0.06 M
   trehalose, or 4\%, 10\%, and 18\% vol/vol of either glycerol or dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO), was examined over 12 h at 15 degrees C. Trehalose
   supplementation resulted in an immediate decline (P < 0.05) of total
   motility. After 12 h, total motility was reduced (P < 0.05) in
   treatments containing 18\% glycerol, and 10\% and 18\% dimethyl
   sulfoxide. The effects of final glycerol concentration (4\% and 10\%),
   glycerol equilibration duration (10 min 1 h, or 3 h) prefreeze, freezing
   rate and the addition of 0.10 M lactose or a combination of 0.10 M
   lactose and 0.11 M raffinose were assessed during three experiments on
   the cryopreservation of postmortem gamete rescue samples in TEST. In all
   experiments, motility and viability were reduced (P < 0.01 postthaw).
   Samples cryopreserved in TEST supplemented with lactose or lactose with
   raffinose using a fast freezing rate (-8 degrees C/min from 4 to -40
   degrees C, then -65 degrees C/min until -165 degrees C) produced the
   highest (P < 0.05) postthaw motility (18.6 +/- 5.5\% and 16.9 +/- 8.5\%,
   respectively), which represented 35\% to 48\% retention of prefreeze
   motility. These results apparently were the best postthaw results of
   dasyurid sperm reported to date and will help lay the foundations for
   developing assisted reproductive technologies for marsupial species. (c)

Title = {The effect of cryoprotectant on kangaroo sperm ultrastructure and
   mitochondrial function},
Journal = {CRYOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-303},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examined the effect of cryoprotectants (20\% DMSO, a 10\%
   DMSO/10\% glycerol mixture, 20\% glycerol and I M sucrose solution) on
   kangaroo sperm structure and function, along with the effect of varying
   concentrations of glycerol on sperm mitochondrial function. Eastern grey
   kangaroo cauda epididymidal spermatozoa were incubated for 10 min at 35
   degrees C in each cryoprotectant and the plasma membrane integrity (PMI)
   and motility assessed using light microscopy. The same samples were
   fixed for TEM and the ultrastructural integrity of the spermatozoa
   examined. To investigate the effect of glycerol on the kangaroo sperm
   mitochondrial function, epididymidal spermatozoa were incubated with
   JC-1 in Tris-citrate media at 35 degrees C for 20 min in a range of
   glycerol concentrations (0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\% and 20\%) and the
   mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and plasma membrane integrity
   determined. As expected, incubation of spermatozoa in 20\% glycerol for
   10 min resulted in a significant reduction in motility, PMI and
   ultrastructural integrity. Interestingly, incubation in 20\% DMSO
   resulted in no significant reduction in motility or PMI but a
   significant loss of structural integrity when compared to the control
   spermatozoa (0\% cryoprotectant). However, 20\% DMSO was overall less
   damaging to sperm ultrastructure than glycerol, a combination of 10\%
   glycerol and 10\% DMSO, and sucrose. While all glycerol concentrations
   had an adverse effect on mitochondrial function, the statistical models
   presented for the relationship between MMP and glycerol predicted that
   spermatozoa, when added to 20\% glycerol, would lose half of their
   initial MMP immediately at 35 degrees C and MMP would halve after 19.4
   min at 4 degrees C. Models for the relationship between PMI and glycerol
   predicted that spermatozoa would lose half of their initial PMI after
   1.8 min at 35 degrees C and PMI would halve after 21.1 min at 4 degrees
   C. These results suggest that if glycerol is to be used as a
   cryoprotectant for kangaroo spermatozoa then it is best administered at:
   4 degrees C and that mitochondrial function is more sensitive to
   glycerol than PMI. Future research should be directed at investigating
   strategies that reduce exposure of spermatozoa to glycerol during
   processing and that test the cryoprotective properties of 20\% DMSO for
   kangaroo spermatozoa. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of cooling and cryopreservation upon
   macropod spermatozoa (eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus and
   red-necked wallaby, Macropus rufogriseus). Sperm survival during and
   after freezing to -30 degrees C or -70 degrees C in minimum essential
   medium (MEM) + 5, 10, 20 or 30\% (v/v) glycerol, MEM + 10 or 20\% (v/v)
   ethylene glycol and MEM containing a mixture of 7.5\% (v/v) glycerol +
   10\% (v/v) dimethylsulphoxide was examined by cryomicroscopy. The
   MEM/glycerol mixtures permitted better post-thaw sperm recovery than the
   other cryoprotectants. After freezing to -30 degrees C at 10 degrees C
   min(-1) in 20\% glycerol, then rewarming at 20 degrees C min(-1),
   flagellar activity resumed in more than 50\% of spermatozoa when the
   temperature increased into the range 5-10 degrees C. However, as the
   temperature increased into the range 20-25 degrees C, motility declined
   rapidly so that less than 5\% motile cells were seen at 35 degrees C.
   Spermatozoa in MEM without cryoprotectant were also examined by
   cryomicroscopy to evaluate changes in flagellar configuration, swimming
   behaviour and viability during cooling from 35 degrees C to
   approximately -7 degrees C, and rewarming to 35 degrees C. Cooling from
   35 to 28 degrees C induced kangaroo spermatozoa to exhibit rigid
   principal-piece bending and non-linear motility, which was reversed by
   further cooling and the spermatozoa resumed their normal linear
   movement. Rewarming induced principal-piece bending in the range of
   20-30 degrees C, but this effect was reversed by further warming.
   Although red-necked wallaby spermatozoa showed these effects,, they also
   exhibited a tendency to form rosette-like clusters during rewarming,
   especially when the temperature reached approximately 14 degrees C. The
   clusters were induced when the flagellar end-pieces became anteriorly
   reflected, producing hook-like flagellar conformations, which then
   became interlinked.},

Abstract = {A sperm-epididymal cell co-culture was shown to be capable of inducing
   the in vitro maturation of spermatozoa from a marsupial species, the
   tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). This system was able to maintain
   wallaby epididymal epithelial cells in vitro for more than 2 months. The
   system also enabled immature wallaby spermatozoa to differentiate from a
   T-shaped to a streamlined form, accompanied by the development of
   progressive motility after co-culture with epididymal cell monolayers
   that had been cultured for 7 days. The addition of inhibitors of actin
   polymerization (latrunculin A or B) to the co-culture system showed that
   wallaby sperm maturation was impaired by the interruption of actin
   organization within the immature spermatozoa. These results indicate
   that actin filaments play a significant role in sperm transformation
   during post-testicular maturation in marsupials. These observations also
   indicate that the marsupial coculture system has the potential to
   greatly increase understanding of sperm-epididymal cell interactions and
   the mechanism of sperm maturation in these species.},

Abstract = {The effects of long-term cooling and freezing on sperm motility are
   described for six marsupial species: the fat-tailed dunnart, koala,
   brushtail possum, long-footed potoroo, northern brown bandicoot and
   ring-tailed possum. The effects of up to eight days of cooling at 4
   degrees C on the motility of dunnart spermatozoa and the effect of
   cryopreservation on spermatozoa of the other species were determined,
   The cryoprotectant used was a Tris-citrate-fructose-egg yolk-glycerol
   diluent. The percentage and rating of sperm motility, and sperm
   structure, as determined by light microscopy, were investigated. Sperm
   motility in the fat-tailed dunnart was retained for up to six days when
   cooled to 4 degrees C, suggesting that sperm from this species have some
   degree of tolerance to cold shock. After this time, however, the
   percentage of motile spermatozoa and their motility rating declined. In
   all species except the fat-tailed dunnart, reinitiation of motility
   following cryopreservation occurred across a range of glycerol
   concentrations (4-17\%). Cryoprotectant containing 6\% and/or 8\%
   glycerol resulted in little change of motility rating or of the
   percentage of live sperm after thawing, although there was some decline
   in the percentage of motile sperm. The unusual structural and motility
   characteristics of dunnart spermatozoa may account for the lack of
   success of sperm cryopreservation in this species.},

Abstract = {The acrosomal status of wallaby spermatozoa was evaluated by light and
   electron microscopy after incubation in 1-100 muM
   lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) for up to 120 min. Treatment with 1 and 10
   muM LPC for 120 min did not lead to acrosomal loss, or detectable
   alteration to the acrosome, as detected by Bryan's staining and light
   microscopy. Incubation with 25 muM LPC had little effect on acrosomal
   loss, however statistically significant changes (P < 0.05) in the
   acrosomal matrix (altered) were detected after 10-min incubation by
   light microscopy. Around 50\% of acrosomes were altered after 20-min
   incubation in 50 muM LPC (P < 0.001), and 40\% of spermatozoa had lost
   their acrosome after 60-min incubation (P < 0.001). Treatment with 75
   and 100 muM LPC led to rapid acrosomal loss from around 50\% of
   spermatozoa within 10 min (P < 0.001), and by 60 min acrosomal loss was
   70-80\%. LPC, like the diacylglycerol DiC-8
   (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol), is thus an effective agent to induce loss
   of the relatively stable wallaby sperm acrosome, and it also induces
   changes within the acrosomal matrix.
   Ultrastructure of the LPC-treated spermatozoa revealed that the plasma
   membrane and the acrosomal membranes were disrupted in a manner similar
   to that seen after detergent treatment (Triton X-100). There was no
   evidence of point fusion between the plasma membrane overlying the
   acrosome and the outer acrosomal membrane. The plasma membrane was the
   first structure to disappear from the spermatozoa. The acrosomal
   membranes and matrix showed increasing disruption with time and LPC
   concentration. Wallaby spermatozoa incubated with LPC at concentrations
   that induced significant acrosomal loss also underwent a rapid decline
   in motility that suggested that acrosomal loss may be due to cell
   damage, rather than a physiological AR. This study concluded that
   LPC-induced acrosomal loss from tammar wallaby spermatozoa is due to its
   action as a natural detergent and not as a phosphoinositide pathway
   intermediate. The study further demonstrates the unusual stability of
   the marsupial acrosomal membranes.        (C)  1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The spermatozoon fibrous sheath contains longitudinal columns and
   circumferential ribs. It surrounds the axoneme of the principal piece of
   the mammalian sperm tail, and may be important in sperm stability and
   motility. Here we describe its assembly during spermiogenesis in a
   marsupial, the brush-tail possum, and compare its structural
   organization with that of eutherian mammals, birds and reptiles.
   Transmission electron microscopy showed that possum fibrous sheath
   assembly is a multistep process extending in a distal-to-proximal
   direction along the axoneme from steps 4 to 14 of spermiogenesis. For
   the most part, assembly of the longitudinal columns occurs before that
   of the circumferential ribs. Immunohistochemical and immunogold
   labelling showed that fibrous sheath proteins are first present in the
   spermatid cytoplasm; at least some of the proteins of the sheath
   precursors differ from those in the mature fibrous sheath. That
   immunoreactivity develops after initiation of chromatin condensation
   suggests that fibrous sheath proteins, or their mRNAs, are stored within
   the spermatid cytoplasmic lobule prior to their assembly along the
   axoneme. These findings are similar to those in laboratory rats, and
   thus suggests that the mode of fibrous sheath assembly evolved in a
   common ancestor over 125 million years ago, prior to the divergence of
   marsupial and eutherian lineages.},

Abstract = {Sminthopsis crassicaudata is a small (approximately 16 g) polyovulatory
   dasyurid marsupial which has the potential to become an important model
   species. This study examined the use of exogenous hormone treatment to
   manipulate the breeding of S. crassicaudata and as a means to obtain
   timed developmental stages for further study. Two thirds (21/32) of the
   females treated with 1.0 or 5.0 I.U. of pregnant mare serum
   gonadotrophin (PMSG) had ovulated when the contents of their
   reproductive tracts were examined 5 or 6 days later. Only one of eight
   females treated with 0.2 I.U. PMSG had ovulated in the same period.
   Although a similar proportion of animals treated with 1.0 I.U. and 5.0
   I.U. ovulated, the ovulation rate was significantly lower when the
   higher dose was administered (mean of 10.5 ovulations per female v. 3.8
   ovulations per female). In addition, the ovaries of 6/8 of the animals
   treated with 5.0 I.U. PMSG had luteinized follicles with degenerating
   oocytes, evidence of over-stimulation. Follicular luteinization also
   occurred in 4/8 animals treated with 1 I.U. PMSG. Oocyte maturation and
   ovulation occurred following PMSG stimulation without injection of
   synthetic gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH). Treatment with a
   10-mu-g dose of GnRH following PMSG seemed to have no effect on the
   outcome.
   Of the females that had ovulated by Day 6, three quarters had mated and
   some had fertilized eggs and two-cell embryos in the oviducts and uteri.
   In a further series of experiments the subsequent development of embryos
   conceived after PMSG treatment was assessed. Two thirds of treated
   females mated within 7 days of treatment and 60\% of these matings
   yielded embryos when examined 11 days after PMSG. However, full-term
   development was only achieved in one animal. Gonadotrophin treatment of
   S. crassicaudata thus may have application as a means to obtain mature
   or maturing oocytes, cleavage stage embryos and blastocysts, but at this
   stage it appears not to offer promise as a method to achieve full-term
   development.},

Abstract = {Electroejaculation (EEJ) has been used successfully to collect samples
   suitable for genome resource banking from a variety of endangered
   wildlife species. Ejaculates can also be used to evaluate the
   reproductive potential of individuals and provide information on seminal
   characteristics to aid in the development of sperm cryopreservation
   techniques. Electroejaculation techniques used for marsupial and
   eutherian species were tested on Tasmanian devils (n = 35). Spermic
   ejaculates were collected in 54\% (19/35) of EEJ attempts. Spermic
   ejaculates were low in volume (3.9 +/- 6.5 x 10(2) mu L, range 10-3000
   mu L) and contained low numbers of spermatozoa (3.3 +/- 7.8 x 10(3)
   spermatozoa per ejaculate, range 6-33 000). The osmolality and pH of
   presumptive urine-free ejaculates were 389 +/- 130 mOsm kg(-1) (range
   102-566) and 7.0 +/- 0.9 (range 6.0-8.0), respectively. Prostatic bodies
   were observed in 79\% (26/33) of ejaculates. Episodic fluctuations in
   serum testosterone concentrations were not detected during the EEJ
   procedure (P > 0.05). Increases observed in serum cortisol
   concentrations during EEJ were less (P < 0.05) than those observed after
   an adrenalcorticotropic hormone challenge and diurnal variation
   suggested that cortisol concentrations are greater during the day than
   at night (P < 0.05). This information can be used to provide range
   values for the future examination of basic endocrine responses and the
   adrenal-pituitary axis of this species. This study also demonstrated
   that spermatozoa-rich devil electroejaculates are more difficult to
   obtain and poorer in quality than those of other marsupials.},

Abstract = {Immunocontraception has been proposed as an effective and humane means
   of controlling overabundant kangaroo populations in Australia. We have
   examined the feasibility of using a sperm-based vaccine for this purpose
   using a model macropod species, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii).
   This study has demonstrated immunocontraception in a marsupial species
   following immunisation of males with homologous spermatozoa. Serum
   anti-sperm IgG titres were associated with a significant reduction in
   fertilisation rates following mating with superovulated female
   wallabies. Antigen-specific I-G penetrated the reproductive tract at the
   rete testis and bound spermatozoa in vivo. I-G was detected bound to the
   acrosome and midpiece regions of both epididymal and ejaculated
   spermatozoa. The absence of adverse testicular pathology and sperm
   movement effects suggests that contraception may have been achieved by
   antibody-mediated blocking of sperm surface antigens essential for
   fertilisation. This study demonstrates that a contraceptive vaccine
   targeting sperm antigens has potential for fertility control in male
   macropods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The diacylglycerol DiC(8) (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; 100 mu mol l(-1))
   was found to induce acrosomal loss in 70\% of wallaby spermatozoa and
   40\% of possum spermatozoa after incubation for 120 min. If 10 mu mol
   calcium ionophore l(-1) was present, the time required to reach these
   end points was reduced to 30 and 60 min, respectively. The
   diacylglycerol OAG (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; 100 mu mol l(-1))
   produced some acrosomal loss, particularly when 10 mu mol calcium
   ionophore l(-1) was present, but when the ionophore was absent, results
   were equivocal. The other diacylglycerol tested DOG
   (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol; 100 mu mol l(-1)) did not induce significant
   acrosomal loss in possum or wallaby spermatozoa. The concentration of
   DiC(8) required to induce acrosomal loss in marsupial spermatozoa
   (50-100 mu mol l(-1)) was relatively high compared with that for
   placental mammals, suggesting a less specific mode of action than enzyme
   activation. Of the diacylglycerols tested alone, only DiC(8) led to
   significant loss of motility. In wallabies, this was detectable after
   incubation for 60 min and in possums after incubation for 120 min. The
   ultrastructure of the DiC(8)-induced acrosomal loss was essentially
   identical to the acrosome reaction described for a broad range of
   placental mammals. A membrane vesicle shroud covered the acrosomal
   surface of the sperm head. The vesicles appeared to be formed by
   multiple point fusions between the plasma membrane and the outer
   acrosomal membrane. The mechanism of DiC(8)-induced acrosomal loss
   remains to be established. However, fusion of plasma membrane with outer
   acrosomal membrane was evident after incubation for 5 min in the
   diacylglycerol, long before a significant decline in motility was
   detected.},

Title = {Potential causes and life-history consequences of sexual size dimorphism
   in mammals},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-115},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Male-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in mammals has been
   explained by sexual selection favouring large, competitive males.
   However, new research has identified other potential factors leading to
   SSD. The aim of this review is to evaluate current research on the
   causes of SSD in mammals and to investigate some consequences of SSD,
   including costs to the larger sex and sexual segregation.
   2. While larger males appear to gain reproductive benefits from their
   size, studies have also identified alternative mating strategies,
   unexpected variance in mating success and found no clear relationship
   between degree of polygyny and dimorphism. This implies that sexual
   selection is unlikely to be the single selective force directing SSD.
   3. Latitude seems to influence SSD primarily through variation in
   overall body size and seasonal food availability, which affect potential
   for polygyny. Likewise, population density influences resource
   availability and evidence suggests that food scarcity differentially
   constrains the growth of the sexes. Diverging growth patterns between
   the sexes appear to be the primary physiological mechanism leading to
   SSD.
   4. Female-biased dimorphism is most adequately explained by reduced
   male-male competition resulting in a decrease in male size.
   Female-female competition for dominance and resources, including mates,
   may also select for increased female size.
   5. Most studies found that sexual segregation arises through asynchrony
   of activity budgets between the sexes. The larger sex can suffer
   sex-biased mortality through increased parasite load, selective
   predation and the difficulty associated with sustaining a larger body
   size under conditions of resource scarcity.
   6. None of the variables considered here appears to contribute a
   disproportionate amount to SSD in mammals. Several promising avenues of
   research are currently overlooked and long-term studies, which have
   previously been biased toward ungulates, should be carried out on a
   variety of taxa.},

Abstract = {Dasyurids are a diverse group of Australian native carnivores and
   insectivores that contains several threatened species. Despite
   successful cryopreservation of sperm from several marsupials, only 3\%
   postthaw motility is reported for dasyurid marsupials. This study
   examined sperm preservation in the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis
   crassicaudata), an experimental model, with supplementary observations
   on the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) and northern quoll (Dasyurus
   hallucatus). In S. crassicaudata, a toxicity trial demonstrated that
   incubation with up to 40\% glycerol did not reduce sperm viability,
   suggesting that glycerol is not toxic to dasyurids. On the basis of this
   finding, S. crassicaudata, D. viverrinus, and D. hallucatus sperm were
   extended to a final concentration of 20\% or 40\% glycerol in
   Tris-citrate fructose and frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor. Postthaw
   sperm from all three species were nonmotile, and vital staining (SYBR14
   and propidium iodide) indicated that sperm were nonviable. However,
   there was no evidence suggesting disruption of normal gross morphology
   or loss of acrosomal integrity when assessed by Bryan's staining. After
   freeze drying, Bryan's staining indicated that approximately 80\% of S.
   crassicaudata sperm had normal acrosomes and no head loss. Despite being
   nonviable, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end
   labeling showed that S. crassicaudata sperm frozen in 40\% glycerol or
   freeze-dried had no DNA damage compared with fresh controls. This study
   has described a method for preservation of the dasyurid sperm nuclei,
   but continued studies are required to achieve viable motile sperm and
   establish tools for the long-term storage of dasyurid sperm. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare cryopreservation, osmotic
   tolerance and glycerol toxicity between mature and immature epididymal
   kangaroo spermatozoa to investigate whether the lack of cryopreservation
   success of cauda epididymidal spermatozoa may be related to the
   increased complexity of the sperm ultrastructure acquired during
   epididymal transit. Caput and cauda epididymidal spermatozoa were
   recovered from red-necked wallabies (RNW; Macropus rufogriseus) and
   eastern grey kangaroos (EGK; M. giganteus). In Experiment 1, caput and
   cauda epididymidal spermatozoa were frozen and thawed using a standard
   cryopreservation procedure in Triscitrate buffer with or without 20\%
   glycerol. Although cryopreservation of caput epididymidal spermatozoa
   resulted in a significant increase in sperm plasma membrane damage, they
   were more tolerant of the procedure than spermatozoa recovered from the
   cauda epididymidis (P< 0.05). In Experiment 2, caput and cauda
   epididymidal EGK spermatozoa were diluted into phosphate-buffered saline
   media of varying osmolarity and their osmotic tolerance determined.
   Plasma membranes of caput epididymidal spermatozoa were more tolerant of
   hypo-osmotic media than were cauda epididymidal spermatozoa ( P< 0.05).
   In Experiment 3, caput and cauda epididymidal RNW spermatozoa were
   incubated in Tris-citrate buffer with and without 20\% glycerol at 35
   and 4 degrees C to examine the cytotoxic effects of glycerol. At both
   temperatures, caput epididymidal spermatozoa showed less plasma membrane
   damage compared with cauda epididymidal spermatozoa when exposed to 20\%
   glycerol ( P< 0.05). These experiments clearly indicate that epididymal
   maturation of kangaroo spermatozoa results in a decreased ability to
   withstand the physiological stresses associated with cryopreservation.},

Abstract = {Marsupial sperm structure has been the focus of many comparative studies
   in the last 30 years. Although the basic organization of the marsupial
   spermatozoon is similar to that of eutherian mammals, spermatozoa from
   this branch of therian evolution have developed a specific suite of
   characters which clearly distinguish them from the Eutheria. This review
   surveys these specializations and examines current knowledge on their
   respective functions and the forces which shaped their evolution.
   Nuclear shaping and stability, the asymmetric positioning of the
   acrosome, and the unusual neck articulation are discussed. Although
   recent observations have provided evidence of a marsupial equatorial
   segment and posterior ring, the marsupial equivalent of the eutherian
   postacrosomal sheath has not been identified. The unusual neck structure
   of marsupial spermatozoa and the mobile articulation of the connecting
   piece are discussed in relation to nuclear rotation and the events
   associated with this process. Increasing flagellar length in some
   species is associated with extremes in flagellar organization and its
   effect on sperm motility is discussed.},

Abstract = {Gonads and sperm pathways of five adult male Metachirus nudicaudatus in
   the reproductive phase were used to describe the morphology of scrotum,
   testicle, and spermatic tract. M. nudicaudatus has a scrotum pre-penis
   which contains the testicles permanently. The scrotal skin is not
   pigmented and has few hairs and glands. The parietal vaginal tunic is
   slightly pigmented. The testicles are oval and connected to the
   epididymis by testicular-epididymal pedicle; they are surrounded
   externally by the testicular capsule and supported by a stroma of
   connective nature. Interstitial cells are the predominant elements in
   abundant intertubular tissue. The seminiferous tubules are wide,
   meandering and surrounded by a fibro-elastic coat, containing myoid
   cells. The seminiferous epithelium is composed of spermatogenic cells
   and Sertoli cells interspersed. The seminiferous tubules converge toward
   the end of the testis capitata, getting coated only support cells,
   featuring a transition region between the seminiferous tubules and
   straight tubules, occupied by a type ``valve{''} structure that
   partially blocks the tubular lumen. Straight tubules together to form a
   single efferent ductule, which runs a small intra-testicular extent,
   penetrates through the tunica and the pedicle testis-epididymis. The
   flexuosa part of the efferent ductule forms a separate lobe in the
   medial part of the body of the epididymis. The epididymis is enveloped
   by a capsule and epididymal comprising the epididymal duct, which is
   quite entangled. The epididymal duct is lined by pseudostratified
   columnar epithelium with simple principal, basal, apical and ``clear
   halo{''} cells. The main cells are prevalent and have morphological and
   histochemical differing characteristics along the duct, enabling to
   characterize nine different epididymal areas. In the lumen of the
   seventh area (top of tail) that starts the pairing of sperm. This
   phenomenon coincides well with morphological change and a larger amount
   of neutral muco-substances is secreted in that area. Vas deferens has
   three parts: fair-epididymal, abdominal and funicular part, based on
   histological and histochemical changes of the epithelium and surrounding
   components. The vas deferens has no bulb and even crosses the ureter
   before flowing into the urethra. The spermatic cord contains the vas
   deferens, testicular artery and veins, lymphatic vessels, nerves and
   developed cremaster muscle. Its components have structural changes in
   the proximal, middle and distal region, with a peculiar admirable
   network.},

Abstract = {The disposition of spermatozoa in the female tract of the dasyurid
   marsupial, Sminthopsis crassicaudata, was examined before and after
   ovulation, by transillumination using differential interference optics.
   At 6-30 h after mating in females with maturing follicles, spermatozoa
   were restricted to special storage crypts that define the isthmus of the
   Fallopian tube. These spermatozoa were mostly immotile and were spear
   shaped, except for 50-200 vanguard spermatozoa within anterior crypts
   that were T shaped due to a rotation of the head on the tail. After
   ovulation and arrival of eggs in the narrow upper ovarian segment of the
   tube, several hundred isthmic spermatozoa migrated to that region,
   dispersed singly or in small groups of variable motility with some
   festooned around eggs. Most clearly displayed a T configuration, and
   subsequently, those remaining in the isthmic crypts also adopted a T
   shape in situ. The motility of mature epididymal spermatozoa and of
   those flushed from the isthmus before and after ovulation was similar in
   vitro, and all were spear shaped except for some T-shaped isthmic
   spermatozoa recovered after ovulation. However, neither spear- nor
   T-shaped active isthmic spermatozoa ever adhered to the zona pellucida
   when incubated with eggs.
   We conclude that transport to and storage of spermatozoa in the isthmus
   of the Fallopian tube, and their later migration up to the fertilization
   site and coincident transformation to a T shape, all are closely
   regulated by the ovarian follicular cycle in Sminthopsis. Only on
   reaching the upper ovarian segment of the Fallopian tube do Sminthopsis
   spermatozoa appear to be able to bind to the egg, when the T shape
   brings the whole surface area of the acrosome into apposition with the
   zona pellucida. These observations are discussed with special reference
   to sperm capacitation, sperm penetration mechanisms, and the different
   idiosyncratic designs of the sperm head in marsupial and eutherian
   mammals, respectively.},

Abstract = {There is a growing need to manage marsupial populations as a means to
   mitigate economic and environmental damage and resolve animal welfare
   problems. In Australia, the problems of population management are highly
   specific and localized. In contrast, in New Zealand the problem is the
   control of the many millions of widely-distributed brushtail possums
   which are the country's major vertebrate pest. The needs of the two
   countries are thus very different but immunocontraception may provide an
   effective and humane alternative to current lethal control strategies.
   This paper discusses the features of marsupial reproduction and
   development that offer potential as targets for immunocontraceptive
   interference, including: (1) sperm production and maturation in the
   male; (2) sperm transport and maturation in the female; and (3) sperm
   and egg antigens and the early embryo. Some of these antigen targets are
   shared with eutherian mammals but others are likely to be unique to
   marsupials.},

Abstract = {Macropod spermatozoa have proven difficult to cryopreserve such that
   empirical studies using high concentrations of glycerol and/or DSMO have
   resulted in only 10\% post-thaw motility. We examined the ultrastructure
   and freeze-fracture of caput and cauda epididymal macropod spermatozoa
   at 35, 4 degrees C and following cryopreservation with and without 20\%
   glycerol. The addition of 20\% glycerol resulted in significant damage
   to the sperm plasma membrane and mitochondria compared to no glycerol at
   the same temperatures (P < 0.05). Following cryopreservation, 20\%
   glycerol significantly improved the preservation of the cauda epididymal
   sperm plasma membrane and mitochondria and reduced the incidence of
   axonemal damage and axonernal spaces. For caput epididymal spermatozoa,
   glycerol only improved the preservation of the plasma membrane following
   cryopreservation (P < 0.05). Freeze fracture microscopy revealed a
   pattern of helically wound intramembranous particles in the plasma
   membrane over the fibre network of the mid piece of the sperm tail. The
   fibre network is an interconnecting cytoskeletal structure found
   underneath the plasma membrane of the kangaroo sperm midpiece and is
   thought to add rigidity to the proximal portion of the sperm tail. After
   thawing, the plasma membrane was damaged such that this structure was
   missing in patches, and the helical rows of particles were mal-aligned.
   On the principal piece, particles were arranged randomly at
   physiological temperatures; however, upon cooling to 4 degrees C with
   20\% glycerol, the particles become aggregated. Once rewarmed (35
   degrees C), particles over the principal piece resumed their random
   organisation. This finding is further evidence of a reversible phase
   transition of the macropod sperm plasma membrane during cooling that is
   not associated with a loss of motility or membrane integrity. (c) 2007

Abstract = {In this study cytoskeletal antigens common to brushtail possum and
   tammar wallaby spermatozoa were characterised using a monoclonal
   antibody (PSA-10). Using indirect immunofluorescence, the PSA-10
   antibody detected antigens predominantly associated with the midpiece
   and principal piece of mature, permeabilised marsupial spermatozoa. The
   principal piece determinant, shared by a variety of other species, was
   found to arise in the marsupial testis. Midpiece localisation of the
   PSA-10 epitope was detected only in marsupial spermatozoa and shown to
   arise in the epididymis. Immunogold labelling demonstrated that the
   PSA-10 antigens were predominantly associated with the fibrous sheath
   and midpiece fibre network of both possum and wallaby spermatozoa.
   Western blotting suggested that two major possum and wallaby sperm
   polypeptides of 158 and 182 kDa were associated with the midpiece fibre
   network, a cytoskeletal structure unique to marsupial spermatozoa. A 32
   kDa polypeptide was associated with the principal piece fibre network
   and/or fibrous sheath. The finding that these marsupial sperm
   cytoskeletal proteins share a common linear epitope suggests that they
   share some sequence similarity. The midpiece fibre network of marsupial
   sperm, like the fibrous sheath, has been proposed to have a structural
   role in providing passive stiffening for the flagellum (Harding et al.,
   1975, 1979; Olsen, 1975). The PSA-10 monoclonal antibody may provide a
   tool for comparative studies of mammalian sperm cytoskeletal proteins,
   particularly the marsupial midpiece fibre network. It may also allow the

Abstract = {Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have significant potential to
   make a meaningful contribution to the conservation of threatened
   wildlife. This is true of Australia's iconic, and endangered koala
   (Phascolarctos cinereus). If developed, ARTs could offer a solution to
   manage genetic diversity and costs in breeding programs and may provide
   frozen repositories for either insurance or the practical production of
   genetically resilient koalas for release and on-ground recovery. Holding
   back the wider use of ARTs for koalas and other wildlife is a lack of
   funding to close the remaining knowledge gaps in the marsupial
   reproductive sciences and develop the reproductive tools needed. This
   lack of funding is arguably driven by a poor understanding of the
   potential contribution ARTs could make to threatened species
   man-agement. We present a review of our cross-disciplinary and
   accessible strategy to draw much needed public attention and funding for
   the development of ARTs in wildlife, using emerging cost and genetic
   modelling arguments and the koala as a case study. (c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {The effect of the anticoagulant, pindone, on the breeding performance
   and survival of relatively free-ranging merino sheep was assessed.
   Pindone (2-pivalyl-1, 3-indandione) was administered orally as a single
   (10, 3, or 2 mg pindone kg(-1) over three consecutive days) or multiple
   exposure (dosing regime repeated after a further 8 days). Prothrombin
   times (PT) increased up to 4-fold in treated sheep, and haemorrhage
   occurred in some instances, particularly with the double dose treatment.
   Deaths of sheep also occurred, usually when the sheep were placed under
   added stress, particularly that associated with shearing. The breeding
   performance of pregnant ewes dosed with pindone was reduced, mainly due
   to an increase in stillborn and nonviable lambs (i.e. deaths within 2
   days of birth). The motility of sperm in treated rams was also affected.
   Pindone persisted in the blood (maximum, 13.2 mg L-1) for up to 14 days
   after the last dose, and the half-life (t1/2) was estimated at similar
   to5 days depending upon the dosing regime. Other tissue residues ranged
   from 17 (fat) to 39 (liver) mg kg(-1). The implications of these
   findings for ongoing responsible use of pindone (anticoagulants) in pest
   control programs are also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {112},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The life history of Antechinus stuartii, a marsupial, is highly
   synchronized and culminates in a brief mating period that is followed by
   complete male mortality. The accessory reproductive tracts of male A.
   stuartii enlarge in association with testosterone and cortisol hormone
   concentrations, but this appears to be unrelated to the spermatogenic
   cycle. The present study examined the effects of testosterone and
   cortisol on the male reproductive tract. Four groups of adult males from
   May (when plasma testosterone and cortisol concentrations are low) were
   given depot injections of testosterone esters or synthetic cortisol in
   doses that mimic concentrations found in males in the breeding period
   (August). Males were given either saline, testosterone only, cortisol
   only, or testosterone plus cortisol. Experimental groups did not differ
   in the seminiferous tubule morphology. However, the cells from the
   caudal end of the epididymides of both testosterone groups were
   considerably hypertrophied compared with males treated with saline or
   cortisol only. Testosterone treatment significantly increased prostate
   and bulbourethral gland mass, although addition of cortisol to the
   testosterone administration diminished this effect. The morphology of
   the accessory reproductive tract of males treated with either saline or
   cortisol only was similar to that of untreated males at the same time of
   year, and the morphology of the accessory reproductive tract of males
   treated with testosterone plus cortisol was similar to that of untreated
   males in the breeding season. Like some other marsupials, the
   spermatogenic cycle in A. stuartii is apparently not correlated with
   androgen activity, while the accessory reproductive tract is affected by
   androgens.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {1997},

Pages = {803-809},
Abstract = {Tammar wallaby spermatozoa were induced to undergo acrosomal loss when
   incubated with arachidonic acid (AA). Ultrastructural examination
   indicated that the AA-induced acrosomal loss occurred via multiple point
   fusions between the outer acrosomal membrane and the overlying plasma
   membrane. This form of acrosomal loss mimicked the physiological
   acrosome reaction (AR) seen in the sperm of eutherian mammals. The
   fusion event was limited to the acrosomal region of the plasma membrane
   and did not proceed past the peri-acrosomal ring. The entire acrosome
   was lost after AA treatment leaving no evidence of a persistent
   equatorial segment-like region. Ultrastructural evidence of AR-like
   membrane fusion was seen immediately on addition of 50 mu g mL(-1) AA
   and a large proportion of sperm examined after five min incubation were
   in the late stages of membrane fusion. Longer-term incubation with AA
   had deleterious effects on wallaby sperm motility, It remains to be
   determined whether the AA-induced membrane fusion observed here
   indicates that AA is involved in the marsupial AR. However, pretreatment
   of sperm with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor HMG significantly
   reduced AA-induced acrosomal loss suggesting that AA may have acted via
   PKC. If this is so, AA is probably physiologically significant and a
   novel pathway may be operating during AR induction in marsupials.},

Abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been raised against marsupial sperm
   proteins to provide insights into the molecular nature of marsupial
   spermatozoa, and the proteins that mediate sperm maturation and
   interaction with the oocyte. This study reports the production of a mAb,
   designated WSA-1, which bound acrosomal and surface determinants on
   tammar wallaby spermatozoa. The acrosomal antigen was first detected in
   the wallaby testis; however, ejaculated spermatozoa demonstrated whole
   cell WSA-1 immunoreactivity as a result of binding an epididymal
   protein. Ultrastructural and agglutination analyses localised the WSA-1
   epitope to the acrosomal matrix and the whole sperm plasmalemma. The
   WSA-1 mAb bound three polypeptides with relative molecular weights of
   35, 31 and 15 kDa on western blots under reducing conditions. The
   N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained for the 35 kDa wallaby sperm
   polypeptide demonstrated identity with the eutherian acrosomal protein
   acrosin. The 31 kDa polypeptide was of epididymal origin and will be the
   subject of a separate study. Further studies of the WSA-1 antigens are
   likely to provide useful insights into the function and maturation of
   marsupial sperm since proacrosin has a number of putative roles in
   eutherian fertilisation, and epididymal proteins are thought to mediate
   sperm maturation and storage.},

Abstract = {Previous research has found the mature spermatozoon of the Musky
   Rat-kangaroo to share many characteristics with other macopodoids, some
   phalangeroids and even the dasyurids. While there have been several
   studies published on the ultrastructure of the mature marsupial
   spermatozoon, there are only a few detailed studies on marsupial
   spermatogenesis. Furthermore, there have been no studies undertaken
   which combine the staging of the epithelial cell cycle with transmission
   electron microscopy to describe the ultrastructural changes in the
   developing spermatozoon during these stages. Such studies have the
   potential to be used in determining the required time taken for certain
   components of the spermatozoa to develop. During this study, eight
   stages of the seminiferous epithelium were observed and the
   ultrastructure of spermatogenesis was divided into nine phases.
   Maturational processes in the epididymides are also described. Among the
   features reported are: the formation of a unique acrosomal granule
   different from those reported in any other marsupial, the absence of
   contraction of the nuclear ring, a conspicuous acrosomal compaction
   process despite the almost 100\% coverage of the dorsal nuclear surface
   and the retention of late spermatids within the seminiferous tubules
   until the early spermatids have developed to the nuclear protrusion
   phase.},

Abstract = {Porcine FSH/LH stimulation successfully induced development of multiple
   large (>= 4 mm) antral follicles in 10 of 11 common wombats. A mean of
   5.5 metaphase II (MII) oocytes were aspirated from wombats that were
   stimulated during the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle (n = 3) or
   after pouch young removal (n = 3). Three subadults (n = 3) and two
   anoestrus adults did not produce XIII oocytes despite pFSH/pLH
   administration.
   In vitro maturation of immature oocytes at the time of aspiration
   doubled the number of MII oocytes that could be collected from pFSH/pLH
   stimulated wombats. Immature oocytes with cumulus attached, matured more
   readily to the MII stage than immature oocytes without cumulus.
   Following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), approximately 5\% of
   the oocytes that were MII at the time of collection cleaved.
   Approximately 5\% of those that were matured by in vitro maturation
   (IVM) formed two polar bodies following ICSI, although they not cleave.
   Parthenogenesis cannot be excluded. This demonstrates that assisted
   reproductive technologies may be applicable to the common wombat. (c)

Abstract = {Macropodid marsupials are important models for developmental and
   comparative immunology studies. Early work on the marsupial immune
   system reported an unusual immunoglobulin isotype switch and weak mixed
   lymphocyte responses, leading to suggestions that the marsupial immune
   system is weaker and more primitive than that of eutherian mammals. More
   recent studies suggest that these results may be due to ineffective
   immunisation regimes and low levels of cross-reactivity between
   eutherian reagents and marsupial immune molecules. The availability of
   genomic resources for the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and other
   marsupial species has facilitated the isolation and characterisation of
   macropodid immune genes. These studies have demonstrated that the
   genetic architecture of the macropodid immune system is comparable in
   gene content and complexity to that of eutherians. Analysis of
   macropodid immune genes is providing insights into the evolution of
   mammalian immunity and how immune function is adapted to unique aspects
   of macropodid physiology, particularly reproduction.},

Abstract = {Plasma androgen concentration was measured in six mature male koalas
   over 23 months. During this time, four animals were housed isolated from
   females. Androgen concentration showed a seasonal change, with a nadir
   about the middle of the year, and began to increase sometime before the
   start of the breeding season. The concentration was greater when males
   were housed with females, even when the females were not yet cycling
   themselves. Changes in androgen concentration were not associated with
   changes in testicular volume. When plasma extracts were examined
   following separation by high pressure liquid chromatography, the major
   circulating androgen was testosterone with only trace amounts of 5
   alpha-dihydrotestosterone present. Plasma androgen fluctuated during the
   day suggesting some form of diurnal rhythm of secretion. Two further
   animals were fitted with vascular access ports to allow more frequent
   blood collection and samples were taken every second day for two months,
   a period that included a major portion of the breeding season. Androgen
   concentration fluctuated widely from 0 nmol L(-1) to 20 nmol L(-1) over
   successive sampling and indicating an episodic pattern of secretion.
   Plasma cortisol concentration was measured in all animals in these
   studies to monitor stress and remained low except when animals were
   undergoing surgery, were being moved to different enclosures or were
   exhibiting reproductive behaviours. Overall, there was no significant
   correlation between the concentration of androgen and cortisol in plasma
   (n = 215). This contrasted with a group of wild-bled animals (n = 4)
   where there was a highly significant negative correlation.},

Title = {Reproductive ecology of wild tammar wallabies in natural and developed
   habitats on Garden Island, Western Australia},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},

Volume = {60},

Pages = {111-119},
Abstract = {Reproduction may be influenced by major environmental changes
   experienced by an entire population as well as variation within a
   population in maternal resource availability or quality. We examined
   relationships between body condition and reproductive traits in two wild
   populations of the seasonally breeding tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii)
   on Garden Island, Western Australia, that differed in access to
   supplemental food resources. Body condition changed predictably over the
   year, with females losing condition over the dry summer and gaining
   condition over the winters, when lactation occurs and most annual
   precipitation falls. Body condition influenced reproduction, with
   females of greater body condition more likely to have a pouch young, and
   to have a larger pouch young, early in the reproductive season. This
   intrapopulation pattern was opposite to that seen across populations -
   females in a native bushland were in poorer condition yet were more
   likely to have pouch young, and had larger pouch young, in March than
   did females living in a water-supplemented habitat on a naval base. Body
   condition did not influence the probability of weaning a pouch young in
   a year, nor did reproductive success influence changes in body condition
   across seasons. Instead, annual variation in precipitation had a
   dramatic effect on population weaning success in the native bushland,
   but not on the naval base. In summary, individual variation in body
   condition as well as large climatic variation influenced the
   reproduction of tammar wallabies on Garden Island, but the nature of the
   effect depended on the different habitats experienced by the two study
   populations.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine the timing of oocyte
   activation, sperm decondensation and pronucleus formation after
   intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI) in the tammar wallaby and to
   determine the fate of sperm structures at an ultrastructural level.
   Metaphase II-stage tammar wallaby oocytes were injected with spermatozoa
   and cultured for 1 (n=15), 2 (n=24), 4 (n=30), 6 (n=14), 8 (n=32), 10
   (n=25), 12 (n=29) or 19 h (n=12). Oocytes were assessed using light,
   fluorescence and electron microscopy. The timing of oocyte activation
   and sperm decondensation after ICSI in the tammar wallaby is relatively
   similar to that of some eutherian species. Resumption of meiosis II was
   observed from 1 h and the first female pronucleus was seen 6 h after
   ICSI. Most oocytes (88\%) possessed a female pronucleus by 10 h. Intact
   acrosomes persisted with intact sperm heads up to 2 h after ICSI. At 10
   h, 80\% of oocytes possessed a male pronucleus. The sperm tail had
   undergone considerable degeneration by 10 h after ICSI, including
   breakdown of the fibrous sheath dense fibres. The identification of
   sperm tail and midpiece remnants adjacent to pronuclei confirms that the
   events observed in wallaby oocytes after ICSI are not due to
   parthenogenetic activation.},

Abstract = {A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) is an X-linked member of the AKAP
   family of scaffold proteins that anchor cAMP-dependent protein kinases
   and play an essential role in fibrous sheath assembly during
   spermatogenesis and flagellar function in spermatozoa. Marsupial
   spermatozoa differ in structural organization from those of eutherian
   mammals but data on the molecular control of their structure and
   function are limited. We therefore cloned and characterized the AKAP4
   gene in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). The gene
   structure, sequence, and predicted protein of AKAP4 were highly
   conserved with that of eutherian orthologues and it mapped to the
   marsupial X-chromosome. There was no AKAP4 expression detected in the
   developing young. In the adult, AKAP4 expression was limited to the
   testis with a major transcript of 2.9 kb. AKAP4 mRNA was expressed in
   the cytoplasm of round and elongated spermatids while its protein was
   found on the principal piece of the flagellum in the sperm tail. This is
   consistent with its expression in other mammals. Thus, AKAP4 appears to
   have a conserved role in spermatogenesis for at least the last 166
   million years of mammalian evolution.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Although yet to be established definitively, it appears that marsupial
   spermatozoa require a process of capacitation and that the mechanisms
   involved may be quite different between the Australian and American
   species. For Australian species, failure to induce this functional event
   in culture has meant that in vitro fertilization (IVF) is yet to be
   achieved. However, in the American species with paired spermatozoa, IVF
   and subsequent embryo development have been obtained under quite simple
   culture conditions. Our understanding of the interactions of marsupial
   spermatozoa with the female tract, and in particular the oviduct, the
   most likely site of capacitation, is discussed. Although the acrosome
   reaction (AR) is an equally critical event in marsupial fertilization it
   appears to be regulated quite differently. The uniquely stable character
   of the marsupial acrosome is examined as well as our current
   understanding of the regulation of the marsupial sperm AR in vivo and in
   vitro.},

Journal = {ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {65-76},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marsupials present a dichotomy in population management; the numbers of
   many Australian marsupial species have declined due to loss of habitat,
   competition from introduced herbivores and predation by introduced
   carnivores, but other species have become locally overabundant in
   Australia of are introduced pests in New Zealand. The manipulation of
   reproduction offers the means to increase or decrease productivity;
   however, considerable fundamental research is required before
   reproductive technologies can be applied to marsupials. Marsupials
   differ from eutherian mammals in several aspects of their reproduction
   including sex differentiation, gamete function and endocrinology, as
   well as in the relative lengths of gestation and lactation. Although
   these differences present unique problems in the application of
   reproductive technologies to marsupials, they also present unique
   opportunities for marsupial-specific fertility control. This paper
   summarises the assisted breeding technologies currently being applied to
   marsupials including superovulation, artificial insemination, in vitro
   fertilization and gene banking; unique marsupial targets for
   contraceptive intervention including gamete production, sperm
   capacitation, gamete surface antigens and embryonic development; and
   some options for the delivery of contraceptive vaccines to marsupial
   populations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The chapter provides a review of the application of reproductive science
   to technologies for marsupial conservation and population management and
   discusses prospects for the future. This includes the status of
   technologies such as sperm freezing, artificial insemination, and
   exogenous hormone treatments to stimulate ovarian activity and cycling
   in the female. Fertility-based population management for introduced pest
   species and over-abundant native marsupials remain an elusive goal.
   Immune-contraceptive approaches, despite demonstration of basic
   effectiveness, have not progressed to field deliverable agents. Emerging
   genetic technologies such as gene drives offer great promise, but gene
   modifications face major challenges to be broadly accepted both socially
   and politically. A main theme is the potential advantages, both genetic
   and economic, of integrating frozen stored genomic material, such as
   sperm, into the captive breeding component of threatened species
   strategies. However, the sperm of many marsupial species display no or
   very poor recovery of motility on thawing. For this reason, it is
   proposed that the traditional assisted breeding paradigm for
   conservation-cervical artificial insemination with thawed frozen sperm,
   based on cattle breeding-is not a viable default strategy. Rather,
   techniques such as sperm injection and emerging stem cell technologies
   that utilize stored frozen cells, and in the case of sperm, immotile
   cells, are better candidates for the development of a more generic
   approach. In addition, this change in focus encourages wide scale
   proactive genome storage when genetic diversity is greatest, without the
   need to demonstrate success in traditional sperm cryopreservation and
   thawing. However, the promise of the potential of reproductive science
   to conservation and non-lethal population management is problematic
   without far greater recognition of, and investment in, the needs of
   wildlife by society.},

Abstract = {Here we report the first use of intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
   in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), to achieve in
   vitro fertilization and cleavage. A single epididymal spermatozoon was
   injected into the cytoplasm of each mature oocyte collected from
   Graafian follicles or from the oviduct within hours of ovulation. The
   day after sperm injection, oocytes were assessed for the presence of
   pronuclei and polar body extrusion and in vitro development was
   monitored for up to 4 days. After ICSI, three of four (75\%) follicular
   and four of eight (50\%) tubal oocytes underwent cleavage. The cleavage
   pattern was similar to that previously reported for in vivo fertilized
   oocytes placed in culture, where development also halted at the 4- to
   8-cell stage. One-third of injected oocytes completed the second
   cleavage division, but only a single embryo reached the 8-cell stage.
   The success of ICSI in the tammar wallaby provided an opportunity to
   examine the influence of the mucoid coat that is deposited around
   oocytes passing through the oviduct after fertilization. The presence of
   a mucoid coat in tubal oocytes did not prevent fertilization by ICSI and
   the oocytes cleaved in vitro to a similar stage as follicular oocytes
   lacking a mucoid coat. Cell-zona and cell-cell adhesion occurred in
   embryos from follicular oocytes, suggesting that the mucoid coat is not
   essential for these processes. However, blastomeres were more closely
   apposed in embryos from tubal oocytes and cell-cell adhesion was more
   pronounced, indicating that the mucoid coat may be involved in
   maintaining the integrity of the conceptus during cleavage.},

Title = {The seminiferous epithelial cycle and microanatomy of the koala

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and southern hairy-nosed wombat
   (Lasiorhinus latifrons) are iconic Australian fauna that share a close
   phylogenetic relationship but there are currently no comparative studies
   of the seminiferous epithelial cell or testicular microanatomy of either
   species. Koala and wombat spermatozoa are unusual for marsupials as they
   possess a curved stream-lined head and lateral neck insertion that
   superficially is similar to murid spermatozoa; the koala also contains
   Sertoli cells with crystalloid inclusions that closely resemble the
   CharcotBottcher crystalloids described in human Sertoli cells. Eighteen
   sexually mature koalas and four sexually mature southern hairy-nosed
   (SHN) wombats were examined to establish base-line data on quantitative
   testicular histology. Dynamics of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in
   the both species consisted of eight stages of cellular association
   similar to that described in other marsupials. Both species possessed a
   high proportion of the pre-meiotic (stages VIII, I III; koala 62.2 +/-
   1.7\% and SHN wombat 66.6 +/- 2.4\%) when compared with post-meiotic
   stages of the seminiferous cycle. The mean diameters of the seminiferous
   tubules found in the koalas and the SHN wombats were 227.8 +/- 6.1 and
   243.5 +/- 3.9m, respectively. There were differences in testicular
   histology between the species including the koala possessing (i) a
   greater proportion of Leydig cells, (ii) larger Sertoli cell nuclei,
   (iii) crystalloids in the Sertoli cell cytoplasm, (iv) a distinctive
   acrosomal granule during spermiogenesis and (v) a highly eosinophilic
   acrosome. An understanding of the seminiferous epithelial cycle and
   microanatomy of testis is fundamental for documenting normal
   spermatogenesis and testicular architecture; recent evidence of orchitis
   and epididymitis associated with natural chlamydial infection in the
   koala suggest that this species might be useful as an experimental model
   for understanding Chlamydia induced testicular pathology in humans.
   Comparative spermatogenic data of closely related species can also
   potentially reflect evolutionary divergence and differences in
   reproductive strategies.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {This study looked at the feasibility of targeting the zona pellucida for
   a contraceptive vaccine as a possible alternative method of control for
   overabundant macropods. Tammar wallabies, as a model for other
   macropods, were immunized with porcine zonae pellucidae (PZP) and were
   found to achieve significant concentrations of antibody to PZP in sera
   and reproductive tract fluids. Wallabies immunized with PZP exhibited
   lower ovarian weight with reduced numbers of antral follicles when
   compared with control animals. Wallabies were placed in a natural mating
   trial followed by an artificial insemination trial. None of the
   PZP-immunized wallabies produced offspring in the natural mating trial
   compared with 67\% of control animals. To further assess fertility, a
   sub-sample of the wallabies were superovulated and artificially
   inseminated. This resulted in all control wallabies producing fertilized
   ova and all PZP-immunized wallabies failing to ovulate. These results
   suggest that immunocontraception based on targeting antigens of the zona
   pellucida may be an effective strategy for fertility reduction in
   macropods.},

Abstract = {Research has begun recently into biocontrol of brushtail possums as the
   only long-term, cost-effective solution to the possum problem in New
   Zealand, where possums cause significant damage to native forests,
   threaten populations of native plants and animals, and infect cattle and
   deer with bovine tuberculosis. Fertility regulation as a means of
   biocontrol has the support of major animal welfare and conservation
   groups in New Zealand. Systems are being investigated, mostly in
   reproduction and development, with the ultimate aim of developing
   immunologically-based fertility regulation (immunocontraception), but
   much basic information essential to such an approach for possums is
   lacking. The key components for the success of this approach-suitable
   vectors expressing possum-specific reproductive antigens sufficiently to
   block reproduction-are reviewed. The social and political issues of
   local, national and international risk and acceptability arising from
   such an approach are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In a number of species of seasonally breeding marsupial, the male is
   fertile throughout the year but there is a marked seasonal change in
   weight of the accessory sexual glands.  In this study, body weight,
   prostate, epididymis and testis weights and plasma concentrations of
   testosterone, LH and prolactin and pituitary content of LH and prolactin
   were determined in male Bennett's wallabies shot at 1-2 month intervals
   over a period of 17 months.  There was a highly significant increase in
   prostate weight which was coincident with the breeding season for this
   species.  A small but significant increase in testis weight was also
   observed but epididymis weight remained unchanged.  Plasma testosterone
   concentrations were significantly increased at a time coincident with
   the increase in prostate weight.  Plasma prolactin and LH concentrations
   were low in most animals and remained unchanged during the study.  In
   contrast, pituitary prolactin and LH contents showed highly significant
   changes, with increasing and peak hormone content preceding maximum
   prostate weight and plasma testosterone concentrations by several
   months.  While these latter results suggest a role for prolactin and LH
   in the seasonal control of the reproductive organs in the male wallaby,
   a more intensive study of the pattern of secretion of these hormones and
   possibly more sensitive hormone assays are required to understand their
   relative roles in regulating the annual cycle of prostate growth.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of superovulation with exogenous
   porcine FSH/LH on the normal hormonal milieu of the tammar wallaby
   (Macropus eugenii). During seasonal and lactational quiescence, groups
   of 6 females were treated with either multiple doses of porcine
   follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (8 x 6 mg i.m., 12 h apart) followed
   by a single subcutaneous injection of 4 mg porcine luteinizing hormone
   (LH) on Day 5 or saline. Blood samples were collected throughout each
   10-day experimental period and each female was examined twice daily for
   signs of a recent copulation. On Day 9, females were killed and their
   reproductive tracts removed for examination and flushed for eggs. During
   both seasonal and lactational quiescence, treatment with porcine FSH/LH
   induced circulating concentrations of progesterone, porcine FSH and
   porcine LH that were within the normal range of the natural tammar
   oestrous cycle. However, higher plasma oestradiol concentrations (30-50
   mug mL(-1)) than would be expected in a natural tammar preovulatory rise
   and the presence of `highly stimulated' ovaries in several of the
   treated animals suggests that some degree of over-stimulation was
   occurring. During both seasonal sampling periods, behavioural oestrus
   was detected in treated tammars in the absence of a withdrawal of
   progesterone. This data suggests that plasma progesterone is not the
   critical factor inducing behavioural oestrus.},

Abstract = {We studied the flow and mixing regimes in isolated segments of the
   terminal ileum of brushtail possums during spontaneous circumferential
   and longitudinal contractions under conditions that allowed backflow and
   compared them with those of inactive segments. Residence time
   distributions (RTDs) were determined by perfusion with two probes of
   different theological properties to which an inert dye marker was added.
   Ileal segment volume and oscillatory flow during the period of RTD
   determination were derived from spatiotemporal maps. High viscosity guar
   gum solution generated RTDs characteristic of laminar flow in inactive
   ileal segments which confirmed that no slip was occurring at the mucosal
   layer. In active segments, motility and consequent oscillatory flow
   imparted significant additional axial dispersion to the flow patterns of
   both probes. Mixing occurred episodically during periods when intestinal
   volume was reduced and onflow was augmented by peristalsis, which may
   prevent the establishment of steady state conditions. Marker
   concentration rose more steeply when active ileal segments were being
   perfused with a probe of similar viscosity to normal digesta than with
   low viscosity Earle's/Hepes solution, each being subject to similar
   levels of oscillatory flow. This indicated that a coarser mixing regime
   prevailed and that absorption of nutrients from viscous digesta would
   rely to a greater degree on molecular diffusion.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted in which female koalas were mated for
   different durations of intromission and ejaculation to confirm that the
   luteal phase of the oestrous cycle in koalas is induced by the physical
   act of mating. Results showed that Induction of a luteal phase in the
   koala usually required a complete duration of penile thrusting behaviour
   from the male. It is proposed that induction of a luteal phase in koalas
   may involve a copuloceptive reflex, triggered by the thrusting of the
   male's penis into the female's urogenital sinus. Although interrupted
   mating in koalas may be used to induce a luteal phase in preparation for
   an artificial insemination programme, this study showed that there is a
   12.5\% probability that pregnancy will result from semen prematurely
   emitted by the teaser male. A dose of 250 iu hCG was administered
   intramuscularly to eight oestrous females to determine whether it was
   possible to induce a luteal phase artificially. In contrast to control
   females, which received sterile saline injections, all females injected
   with hCG showed a significant increase in progestogen concentration
   above that of basal values, indicating that a luteal phase had been
   induced successfully.},

Abstract = {Multiple paternity within broods or litters occurs in many species
   across a variety of social mating systems. Here we present data on
   paternity patterns in the agile antechinus, Antechinus agilis, a small
   carnivorous marsupial. In this species, all males die after a highly
   synchronised breeding season and females store sperm in oviducal crypts
   for about 2 weeks. Previous work suggests that the species has a lekking
   promiscuous mating system; however, in the absence of field data on
   paternity, this is not confirmed. In our study, microsatellite data from
   two field-seasons show that of the 47 litters sampled, 46 litters were
   fathered by more than I male, with many litters sired by a minimum of 3
   males (n=22). Kinship analysis showed that litters were most likely
   sired by between I and 7 males, with an average for 1st-year breeding
   females of 4.1 in 1999 (n=16) and 3.3 in 2000 (n=23). For 2nd-year
   females, the estimated number of sires was 4.0 in 1999 (n=3) and 2.6 in
   2000 (n=5). The number of sires per litter correlated positively with
   the number of pouch young in the litter. Our data clearly show multiple
   matings by females during a single oestrus period, indicating the
   potential for sperm competition. Females may mate with multiple males to
   ensure fertility (direct benefit), since male ejaculates contain low
   numbers of spermatozoa and all males may die before females ovulate.
   Furthermore, females may gain indirect benefits from mating with
   multiple males, such as genetic compatibility.},

Abstract = {Using molecular techniques, we examined patterns of paternity in
   Virginia opossums occupying a highly fragmented agricultural landscape
   in northern Indiana. During 2008, we collected tissue from 64 females
   and their pouch young in 34 forest patches distributed over a 1100-km(2)
   region. Using genotypes from 10 microsatellite loci, we determined the
   minimum number of fathers contributing to each litter using GERUD 1.0.
   Genotyped offspring with known mothers were then analyzed using CERVUS
   3.0, incorporating genotypes from 317 males sampled from 2007-2008 to
   identify potential fathers. Our analyses revealed that promiscuity was
   common among females, with 26 (41\%) litters having >= 2 sires. Despite
   the fact that we intensively sampled forest patches for potential
   fathers, we only were able to identify 13 fathers contributing to 14
   litters, with an average Euclidean distance of 18.7 km between
   father-offspring pairs found in disparate patches (N = 6). Our inability
   to identify most (85\%) fathers of sampled litters, coupled with the
   extensive distances observed between putative father-offspring pairs,
   suggests that opossums may not maintain explicit home ranges in highly
   fragmented landscapes.},

Abstract = {The zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular matrix that surrounds
   mammalian oocytes. In eutherians it is formed from three or four
   proteins (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, ZP4). In the few marsupials that have been
   studied, however, only three of these have been characterised (ZP2, ZP3,
   ZP4). Nevertheless, the composition in marsupials may be more complex,
   since a duplication of the ZP3 gene was recently described in one
   species. The aim of this work was to elucidate the ZP composition in
   marsupials and relate it to the evolution of the ZP gene family. For
   that, an in silico and molecular analysis was undertaken, focusing on
   two South American species (gray short-tailed opossum and common
   opossum) and five Australian species (brushtail possum, koala, Bennett's
   wallaby, Tammar wallaby and Tasmanian devil). This analysis identified
   the presence of ZP1 mRNA and mRNA from two or three paralogues of ZP3 in
   marsupials. Furthermore, evidence for ZP1 and ZP4 pseudogenes in the
   South American subfamily Didelphinae and for ZP3 pseudogenes in two
   marsupials is provided. In conclusion, two different composition models
   are proposed for marsupials: a model with four proteins (ZP1, ZP2 and
   ZP3 (two copies)) for the South American species and a model with six
   proteins (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 (three copies) and ZP4) for the Australasian
   species.},

Abstract = {The aims of the present study were to examine the variability of
   testosterone secretion in the Virginia Opossum over a 24 h period and to
   develop a testosterone stimulation test that would provide an index of
   the prevailing testosterone biosynthetic capacity of the testes; the
   latter was used to clinically evaluate the efficacy of a
   gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist contraceptive. Sexually-mature
   captive opossums (n = 12) located in Africam Safari (Mexico) sampled
   every 12 h over 24 h consistently showed basal (< 0.21 ng mL(-1)) blood
   testosterone concentrations. Intra-muscular injection of buserelin (2 mu
   g mL(-1)) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; 1000 IU) resulted in
   an increase (P < 0.05) of plasma testosterone concentrations with
   maximal concentrations (3.9 mu g mL(-1) and 5.8 ng mL(-1) respectively)
   occurring 120 min after injection. Plasma testosterone declined
   relatively rapidly to basal concentrations after 240 min with hCG but
   remained elevated after the same period of time with buserelin. Male
   opossums treated with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) a controlled-release
   deslorelin implant (Suprelorin; 4.7 mg deslorelin) were evaluated over a
   10-week period for changes in testosterone secretion (hCG stimulation
   test) and sperm production (spermatorrhea). At the end of this period,
   the animals were hemi-castrated and their relative testicular
   quantitative histology compared. Testosterone concentration decreased
   over the course of the study in both treated and control animals (P <
   0.0001) but there was no apparent effect of deslorelin on testosterone
   secretion, testicular histology (relative proportions of testicular cell
   types and seminiferous tubule diameter), or sperm production (presence
   of sperm in the cauda epididymis or urine).},

Abstract = {Non-invasive techniques were used to investigate the reproductive
   biology of captive squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) for 3 months
   during the breeding season. The squirrel glider is a medium-sized
   marsupial glider of eastern Australia and is currently listed as a
   threatened species as a result of habitat destruction and fragmentation.
   Urinary cytology was used to determine the timing of oestrus, and the
   presence of sperm confirmed mating. Progesterone and oestradiol-17 beta
   were identified in faecal samples via thin-layer chromatography, and
   were used to characterise the reproductive cycle. Reproductive activity
   was observed in three of four females, with births occurring during June
   and July. A preoestrus increase in faecal oestradiol-17 beta was
   detected in a single female, whilst significant increases occurred post
   partum ( +/- 2 days) in two of four females, suggesting that the
   squirrel glider may undergo a postpartum oestrus. Faecal progesterone
   profiles showed low concentrations before oestrus and significantly
   elevated concentrations after oestrus, which were maintained throughout
   pregnancy. Parturition coincided with a decrease in progesterone
   concentrations ( +/- 1 day). This study successfully used non-invasive
   monitoring of urinary cytology and faecal steroids to define luteal and
   gestational length as 16 - 17 days, a previously unpublished detail.},

Abstract = {Marsupials represent one of three extant mammalian subclasses with very
   unique characteristics not shared by other mammals. Most notably, much
   of the development of neonates immaturely born after a relatively short
   gestation takes place in the external environment. Among marsupials, the
   gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica; hereafter ``the
   opossum{''}) is one of very few established laboratory models. Due to
   many biologically unique characteristics and experimentally advantageous
   features, the opossum is used as a prototype species for basic research
   on marsupial biology.(1,2) However, in vivo studies of gene function in
   the opossum, and thus marsupials in general, lag far behind those of
   eutherian mammals due to the lack of reliable means to manipulate their
   genomes. In this study, we describe the successful generation of genome
   edited opossums by a combination of refined methodologies in
   reproductive biology and embryo manipulation. We took advantage of the
   opossum's resemblance to popular rodent models, such as the mouse and
   rat, in body size and breeding characteristics. First, we established a
   tractable pipeline of reproductive technologies, from induction of
   ovulation, timed copulation, and zygote collection to embryo transfer to
   pseudopregnant females, that warrant an essential platform to manipulate
   opossum zygotes. Further, we successfully demonstrated the generation of
   gene knockout opossums at the Tyr locus by microinjection of pronuclear
   stage zygotes using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, along with germline
   transmission of the edited alleles to the F1 generation. This study
   provides a critical foundation for venues to expand mammalian reverse
   genetics into the metatherian subclass.},

Title = {NATAL DISPERSAL AND PHILOPATRY IN THE CARNIVOROUS MARSUPIAL
   PHASCOGALE-TAPOATAFA (DASYURIDAE)},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {99},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal in semelparous
   carnivorous marsupials (Phascogalinae) have previously been hypothesized
   to be maternal aggression and inbreeding avoidance, respectively. This
   study tests these hypotheses by exposing 26 litters of Phascogale
   tapoatafa to a diverse range of social and environmental conditions
   that: potentially affect dispersal(e. g. supplemental feeding,
   post-weaning desertion by the mother, orphaning, and release of
   subadults into unoccupied habitat). The mean dispersal age was 162 +/-
   5.6 d, which is about 3 wk after weaning is complete. Juvenile dispersal
   was strongly male biased under all conditions, suggesting that extrinsic
   proximate causes do not adequately account for male emigration. Home
   range establishment by males was contingent on the presence of females.
   Half of the monitored daughters were philopatric, and others typically
   settled adjacent to the natal site, thus possibly enhancing their
   reproductive potential by occupying an area of known resource quality.
   Because philopatry increases the risk of incest, females may be selected
   to preferentially mate with unrelated males (immigrants), when they are
   available, to avoid inbreeding. If so, the presence of immigrant males
   would reduce the probability of locally born, related males reproducing
   at their natal site. Thus inbreeding avoidance by females may create
   local mate competition among males and select for male dispersal.
   Emigration also ensured that males avoided inbreeding, but, if they
   dispersed into unoccupied habitat, male P. tapoatafa often returned to
   the natal area. This `boomerang strategy' of returning to mate with
   related females suggests that, in the absence of conspecifics along the
   dispersal path of a male, mate competition will be weak at the natal
   site and female mate choice will not preclude related males. Thus while
   inbreeding avoidance by either or both sexes is perhaps the most
   parsimonious explanation of male-biased emigration, dispersal patterns
   were apparently strongly influenced by additional factors, so that the
   ultimate causation of the dispersal regime may be more complex.},

Abstract = {Four types of contractile activity were identified and characterised in
   the isolated triple haustrated proximal colon of the rabbit using
   high-definition spatiotemporal mapping techniques. Mass peristalses were
   hexamethonium-sensitive deep circular contractions with associated
   taenial longitudinal contractile activity that occurred irregularly and
   propagated rapidly aborad, preceded by a zone of local lumen distension.
   They were sufficiently sustained for each event to occupy the length of
   the isolated colonic segment and the contraction persisted longer orally
   than aborally, the difference being more pronounced when lumen contents
   were viscous. Haustra were bounded by deep even-spaced ring contractions
   that progressed slowly aborad (haustral progression). Haustral formation
   and progression were hexamethonium-sensitive and coordinated across
   intertaenial domains. Ripples were hexamethonium-resistant phasic
   circular contractions that propagated predominantly orad at varying
   rates. In the presence of haustra, they were uncoordinated across
   intertaenial domains but were more coordinated when haustra were absent.
   Fast phasic contractions were relatively shallow hexamethonium-resistant
   contractions that propagated rapidly in a predominantly aborad
   direction. Fast phasic circular contractions were accompanied by taenial
   longitudinal muscle contractions which increased in amplitude prior to a
   mass peristaltic event and following the administration of
   hexamethonium. On the basis of the concurrence and interaction of these
   contractile activities, we hypothesise that dual pacemakers are present
   with fast phasic contractions being modulated by the interstitial cells
   of Cajal in the Auerbach's plexus (ICC-MY) while ripples are due to the
   submucosal ICC (ICC-SM). Further, that ICC-SM mediate the enteric motor
   neurons that generate haustral progression, while the intramuscular ICC
   (ICC-IM) mediate mass peristalsis. The orad movement of watery fluid was
   possibly due to ripples in the absence of haustra.},

Title = {Chronic captivity stress in wild animals is highly species-specific},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Wild animals are brought into captivity for many reasons-conservation,
   research, agriculture and the exotic pet trade. While the physical needs
   of animals are met in captivity, the conditions of confinement and
   exposure to humans can result in physiological stress. The stress
   response consists of the suite of hormonal and physiological reactions
   to help an animal survive potentially harmful stimuli. The
   adrenomedullary response results in increased heart rate and muscle tone
   (among other effects); elevated glucocorticoid (GC) hormones help to
   direct resources towards immediate survival. While these responses are
   adaptive, overexposure to stress can cause physiological problems, such
   as weight loss, changes to the immune system and decreased reproductive
   capacity. Many people who work with wild animals in captivity assume
   that they will eventually adjust to their new circumstances. However,
   captivity may have long-term or permanent impacts on physiology if the
   stress response is chronically activated. We reviewed the literature on
   the effects of introduction to captivity in wild-caught individuals on
   the physiological systems impacted by stress, particularly weight
   changes, GC regulation, adrenomedullary regulation and the immune and
   reproductive systems. This paper did not review studies on captive-born
   animals. Adjustment to captivity has been reported for some
   physiological systems in some species. However, for many species,
   permanent alterations to physiology may occur with captivity. For
   example, captive animals may have elevated GCs and/or reduced
   reproductive capacity compared to free-living animals even after months
   in captivity. Full adjustment to captivity may occur only in some
   species, and may be dependent on time of year or other variables. We
   discuss some of the methods that can be used to reduce chronic captivity
   stress.},

Title = {Breeding in the fat-tailed dunnart following ovarian suppression with

Abstract = {Lucrin Depot (AbbVie), a 1-month microsphere gonadotrophin-releasing
   hormone (GnRH) agonist preparation, was investigated as a potential
   agent to synchronise cycling in the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis
   crassicaudata). Forty-eight randomly selected females were treated with
   5 or 10 mg kg(-1) Lucrin Depot (n = 24 per dose). Eighteen females per
   treatment had their reproductive activity scored at 4, 8, 12 and 16
   weeks using two ovarian (Graafian follicle and corpus luteum status) and
   two reproductive tract (uterine and vaginal muscularity and vascularity)
   parameters that formed a reproductive activity score. Six females per
   treatment were paired with a male at 4 weeks. Fertility was assessed
   between 8 and 16 weeks by pouch check, and thereafter by dissection. The
   effects of the 5 and 10 mg kg(-1) doses were statistically equivalent.
   Females showed suppression at 4-8 weeks, an increase in reproductive
   activity at 8-12 weeks and all were cycling normally at 16 weeks. Six
   pouch young were born at 12 weeks to two females treated with the 5 mg
   kg(-1) dose. Nine embryos were recovered at 16 weeks from two females
   treated with the 10 mg kg(-1) dose. In conclusion, Lucrin Depot can
   suppress breeding, and fertile mating can occur in subsequent cycles in
   the dunnart. There is potential for Lucrin Depot to be used as an
   assisted breeding tool, but it may need to be combined with ovarian
   stimulation treatment to achieve practical levels of synchronisation in
   the fat-tailed dunnart.},

Abstract = {In this study the ultrastructural organization of the koala oocyte and
   the thickness of the surrounding extracellular coat, the zona pellucida,
   has been determined to ascertain whether there is coevolution of the
   morphology of the female gamete with that of the highly divergent male
   gamete that is found in this marsupial species. Ovaries from several
   adult koalas were obtained and prepared for transmission electron
   microscopy. Oocytes in large tertiary follicles were somewhat smaller
   than those of most other marsupials, although their ultrastructural
   organization appeared similar and included many yolk vesicles. The zona
   pellucida surrounding the oocytes in tertiary follicles was
   approximately 8 mu m thick and thus is of similar thickness to that of
   some eutherian mammals but at least twice as thick as that of most
   marsupial species so far studied. The results indicate that the koala
   oocyte is unusually small for a marsupial species whereas the zona
   pellucida is, by contrast, much thicker. How this relates to sperm-egg
   interaction at the time of fertilization has yet to be determined.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The Tasmanian tiger or thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was an iconic
   Australian marsupial predator that was hunted to extinction in the early
   1900s. Despite sharing striking similarities with canids, they failed to
   evolve many of the specialized anatomical features that characterize
   carnivorous placentalmammals. These evolutionary limitations are thought
   to arise from functional constraints associated with the marsupial mode
   of reproduction, in which otherwise highly altricial young use their
   well-developed forelimbs to climb to the pouch and mouth to suckle. Here
   we present the first three-dimensional digital developmental series of
   the thylacine throughout its pouch life using X-ray computed tomography
   on all known ethanol-preserved specimens. Based on detailed skeletal
   measurements, we refine the species growth curve to improve age
   estimates for the individuals. Comparison of allometric growth trends in
   the appendicular skeleton (fore- and hindlimbs) with that of other
   placental and marsupial mammals revealed that despite their unique adult
   morphologies, thylacines retained a generalized early marsupial
   ontogeny. Our approach also revealed mislabelled specimens that
   possessed large epipubic bones (vestigial in thylacine) and differing
   vertebral numbers. All of our generated CT models are publicly
   available, preserving their developmental morphology and providing a
   novel digital resource for future studies of this unique marsupial.},

Title = {Antimicrobial Protection of Marsupial Pouch Young},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Marsupials diverged from eutherian mammals about 148 million years ago
   and represent a unique lineage of mammals with distinctive morphological
   and reproductive characteristics. Marsupials have significantly shorter
   gestation periods than eutherians. Pregnancy typically ranges from 15 to
   35 days, with young being born at a very early developmental stage and
   lacking differentiated lymphoid tissues and mature effector cells.
   Recent microbiome studies of the marsupial pouch revealed that marsupial
   young can face intense microbial challenges after birth, as the pouch
   contains a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
   Antimicrobials are believed to play a significant role in the immune
   protection of marsupial newborns during their pouch life. The skin of
   the post-reproductive pouch secretes antimicrobial lysozyme and
   dermcidin, which may contribute to the decreased density of certain
   bacteria in the pouch. A range of antimicrobial agents, such as
   immunoglobulins, lysozyme, transferrin, and cathelicidins, have been
   identified in marsupial milk. Antimicrobial assays have revealed that
   marsupial cathelicidins have broad-spectrum activity against a variety
   of bacteria and fungi, including several multi-drug resistant strains.
   In this article, we will review the action mechanisms of these
   antimicrobial compounds and discuss how they protect marsupial newborns
   from potentially pathogenic bacteria inside the pouch. We will also
   discuss the potential of marsupial antimicrobial compounds as a source
   of novel antibiotics.},

Abstract = {The corpus luteum (CL) is a transitory organ which has a regulatory role
   in reproduction. Sharks, amphibians and reptiles have corpora lutea that
   produce progesterone which influences the rate of embryonic development.
   The egg-laying monotremes and the two major mammalian groups, eutherian
   and marsupial, have a CL that secretes progesterone. Most eutherians
   have allowed for the uterine development of their young by extending the
   length of the oestrous cycle and the CL or placenta actively secretes
   progesterone until birth. Gestation in the marsupial does not extend
   beyond the length of an oestrous cycle and the major part of fetal
   development takes place in the pouch. Where the extension of the
   post-luteal phase in the eutherian has allowed for the uterine
   development of young, the marsupial has extended the pre-luteal phase of
   the oestrous cycle and has evolved an alternative reproductive strategy,
   embryonic diapause.
   The mechanism for the secretion of hormones from the CL has been
   controversial for many years. Densely-staining secretory granules have
   been observed in the CL of sharks, marsupials and eutherians. These
   granules have been reported to contain relaxin, oxytocin or mesotocin,
   and progesterone. A hypothesis to suit all available data is that all
   hormones secreted by the CL are transported within such granules.
   In conclusion, although there are obvious differences in the mode of
   reproduction in the two main mammalian groups, it is apparent that there
   is a great deal of similarity in the hormonal control of regression of
   the CL and parturition.},

Title = {Differential expression of mesotocin receptors in the uterus and ovary

Journal = {REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {129},
Number = {5},
Pages = {639-649},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mesotocin, an oxytocin-like peptide, is released in highest
   concentrations during parturition in macropodid marsupials. in late
   pregnant wallabies, uterine sensitivity to mesotocin increases markedly
   in the myometrium of the gravid uterus. This coincides with a
   significant increase in myometrial mesotocin receptor concentrations 3-4
   days before term. To date, there is no information on mesotocin receptor
   gene expression in female wallaby reproductive tissues. This study aimed
   to examine mesotocin receptor gene expression in the uterus and ovaries
   of pregnant tammar wallabies, and to localise mesotocin receptors within
   the uterus. An RT-PCR strategy produced a consensus nucleotide sequence
   of 834 bp, which encoded 278 amino acids of transmembrane domains I to
   VI. This protein sequence has approximately 80\% homology with the
   bovine and rat oxytocin receptor exon 2 region. Only one mesotocin
   receptor was detected in the tammar genome. The myometrium and mammary
   gland both expressed a 4.1 kb mesotocin receptor gene transcript.
   Myometrial mesotocin receptor gene expression increased on day 22 of the
   26-day gestation and was significantly higher in the gravid than the
   non-gravid uterus in late pregnancy. This pattern of mesotocin receptor
   gene expression paralleled mesotocin receptor concentrations. Mesotocin
   binding sites were localised only to the myometrium, the highest
   densities being observed in the gravid uterus. Finally, this study
   showed high expression of mesotocin receptors in the corpus luteum. The
   pattern of luteal mesotocin receptor expression differed from the
   myometrium, with a decrease in mesotocin receptors occurring on the day
   of expected births.},

Volume = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {An extracellular matrix that mediates critical steps in fertilization
   and early development surrounds all vertebrate eggs. In mice and humans,
   this matrix is known as the zona pellucida and comprises three
   glycoproteins: ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3. Homologues of these proteins isolated
   from other vertebrates have conserved protein motifs that may be
   important for establishing a common fibrillar structure. However,
   specific but contradictory biological roles have been assigned to
   individual egg coat proteins based on assays in vitro in a wide range of
   species. Mouse lines lacking either ZP1 or ZP3 have been established
   with abnormal or absent zona matrices and varying degrees of infertility
   to examine zona structure and function in vivo. By crossing mouse lines
   lacking individual zona proteins with those expressing human homologues,
   the structural integrity of the zona matrix can be restored. Because
   mouse and human spermatozoa exhibit order-specific binding to the zona
   pellucida, mice with `humanized' chimaeric zonae may provide an
   experimental system to elucidate the molecular basis of sperm-zona
   interaction.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {263-267},
Abstract = {Plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T-4) and growth hormone (GH) were
   measured in the developing bandicoot from 21 through to 69 days post
   partum. Thyroxine concentrations increased from 7 ng mL(-1) at 21 days
   post partum to reach a maximum of around 40 ng mL(-1) approximately 40
   days post partum. After this time, plasma T-4 concentrations decreased
   until about 50 days post partum, when levels were not different from
   those in the adult (9.2 +/- 0.7 ng mL(-1), n = 10). In contrast, GH
   concentrations were greatest early in pouch life, with a maximum
   concentration of 88.2 ng mL(-1) at 24 days post partum, and thereafter
   declined to adult levels (4.9 +/- 0.9 ng mL(-1) n = 7) by about 60 days
   post partum. The temporal relationship between T-4 and GH in the
   developing bandicoot is similar to that seen in developing eutherian
   mammals, but in the latter species, peak plasma T-4 and the decline in
   GH occur before or soon after parturition, whereas in the bandicoot
   these events occur more than one month post partum. This comparison
   between eutherian mammals and a marsupial indicates that the timing of
   these endocrine changes correlates with key developmental or
   maturational changes rather than the time of parturition.},

Title = {A role for selective contraception of individuals in conservation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {546-558},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Contraception has an established role in managing overabundant
   populations and preventing undesirable breeding in zoos. We propose that
   it can also be used strategically and selectively in conservation to
   increase the genetic and behavioral quality of the animals. In captive
   breeding programs, it is becoming increasingly important to maximize the
   retention of genetic diversity by managing the reproductive contribution
   of each individual and preventing genetically suboptimal breeding
   through the use of selective contraception. Reproductive suppression of
   selected individuals in conservation programs has further benefits of
   allowing animals to be housed as a group in extensive enclosures without
   interfering with breeding recommendations, which reduces adaptation to
   captivity and facilitates the expression of wild behaviors and social
   structures. Before selective contraception can be incorporated into a
   breeding program, the most suitable method of fertility control must be
   selected, and this can be influenced by factors such as species life
   history, age, ease of treatment, potential for reversibility, and
   desired management outcome for the individual or population.
   Contraception should then be implemented in the population following a
   step-by-step process. In this way, it can provide crucial, flexible
   control over breeding to promote the physical and genetic health and
   sustainability of a conservation dependent species held in captivity.
   For Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii), black-flanked rock
   wallabies (Petrogale lateralis), and burrowing bettongs (Bettongia
   lesueur), contraception can benefit their conservation by maximizing
   genetic diversity and behavioral integrity in the captive breeding
   program, or, in the case of the wallabies and bettongs, by reducing
   populations to a sustainable size when they become locally overabundant.
   In these examples, contraceptive duration relative to reproductive life,
   reversibility, and predictability of the contraceptive agent being used
   are important to ensure the potential for individuals to reproduce
   following cessation of contraception, as exemplified by the wallabies
   when their population crashed and needed females to resume breeding.},

Abstract = {Induced ovulation maximizes captive breeding success, increasing
   productivity and facilitating the contribution of otherwise infertile
   animals to the genetic pool. in marsupials, induced ovulation to produce
   fertile young is unknown. Here we present an induction protocol
   efficient in inducing non-cycling and non-reproductive females to cycle,
   mate, ovulate, and conceive. Ovulation was induced in Sminthopsis
   macroura using an initial injection of 0.06 IU equine serum gonadotropin
   (eSG)/g (time 0), followed on day 4 by 0.04 IU eSG/g. Using this
   induction regime, the timing of follicular and embryonic development
   mimics natural cycles and results in the birth of viable, fertile young.
   Response to induction is not significantly affected by animal age,
   making this protocol an effective conservation tool. We have established
   a time-table of development following induction, providing a source of
   precisely timed research material. This is the first induced ovulation
   protocol in any marsupial to result in demonstrated fertile offspring
   and to allow the reliable collection of known-age samples during both
   the follicular phase and the gestation period. Reproduction (2010) 139

Abstract = {The gametes of eutherian mammals present some fundamental enigmas in
   regard to their structure and behaviour that have not been solved by a
   focus on the Eutheria alone. Although the evidence is limited still,
   some clues are suggested in comparison with representative American and
   Australian marsupials, whose gametes have undergone parallel, although
   sometimes quite different, evolutionary changes to those of eutherian
   mammals. The contrasts between them illuminate basic questions about the
   functions of the epididymis and sperm capacitation, about sperm numbers
   and sperm production, about the function of the cumulus oophorus and the
   configuration of the Fallopian tube and, not least, about gamete design
   and its bearing on the mechanisms by which spermatozoa penetrate the egg
   coat.},

Abstract = {Despite many fundamental similarities between the gametes of marsupials
   and placental mammals, the regulation and timing of prefertilization
   gamete maturation are quite different. The marsupial acrosome is
   remarkably stable and an acrosome reaction (AR) is not induced by
   reagents effective for the sperm of placental mammals. The
   ultrastructure of the marsupial sperm AR is essentially similar to that
   of placental mammals, however, whether an equatorial segment (ES)
   persists to serve as the site of sperm-egg membrane fusion is unclear.
   Diacylglycerol induction of the AR suggests that the sperm. of
   Australian species lack an ES, yet an ES-like region appears to be
   involved in fertilization in the opossum Monodelphis. The marsupial
   oocyte, unlike those of placentals, continues to grow throughout
   follicular life and major cytoplasmic maturation events occur late in
   oocyte development. Cortical granules only become evident shortly before
   ovulation and mature dark granules may only appear after ovulation.
   Further, the zona pellucida (ZP) changes in character and function
   during the peri-ovulatory period. In vitro fertilization has been
   achieved for an opossum but not for any Australian marsupial, owing to
   failure of sperm-ZP binding. Requirement for a sperm maturation process
   is likely, but capacitation treatments used for placental sperm in vitro
   have been ineffective. Since it is now feasible to experimentally
   manipulate marsupial gametes in vitro major advances in our
   understanding of their function can be expected.},

Abstract = {The effect of treatment with Lucrin Depot (1 month), a microsphere
   gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist preparation, was investigated in
   the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) as a potential
   strategy to synchronise cycling. The status of the ovaries (ovarian
   size, number and size of Graafian follicles and corpora lutea) and
   reproductive tract (weight, vascularity and muscularity) in twelve
   untreated females were assessed to establish the activity parameters for
   randomly selected cycling animals. Thirty-six females were treated with
   1mgkg(-1) (n=12), 10mgkg(-1) (n=12) or 20mgkg(-1) (n=12) Lucrin Depot.
   At 4, 6 and 8 weeks the reproductive tracts were assessed using the
   criteria developed in the untreated females. All of the females treated
   with 10mgkg(-1) showed suppression at 4 weeks and 25\% showed return of
   reproductive activity at 8 weeks. A dose of 1mgkg(-1) did not appear to
   suppress reproductive activity and 20mgkg(-1) gave equivocal results,
   with evidence of both suppression and activity. The results indicate
   that Lucrin Depot appears to be a promising agent to regulate and
   potentially synchronise breeding activity in the fat-tailed dunnart.},

Title = {Surface reflectance drives nest box temperature profiles and thermal
   suitability for target wildlife},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Thermal properties of tree hollows play a major role in survival and
   reproduction of hollow-dependent fauna. Artificial hollows (nest boxes)
   are increasingly being used to supplement the loss of natural hollows;
   however, the factors that drive nest box thermal profiles have received
   surprisingly little attention. We investigated how differences in
   surface reflectance influenced temperature profiles of nest boxes
   painted three different colors (dark-green, light-green, and white:
   total solar reflectance 5.9\%, 64.4\%, and 90.3\% respectively) using
   boxes designed for three groups of mammals: insectivorous bats,
   marsupial gliders and brushtail possums. Across the three different box
   designs, dark-green (low reflectance) boxes experienced the highest
   average and maximum daytime temperatures, had the greatest magnitude of
   variation in daytime temperatures within the box, and were consistently
   substantially warmer than light-green boxes (medium reflectance), white
   boxes (high reflectance), and ambient air temperatures. Results from
   biophysical model simulations demonstrated that variation in diurnal
   temperature profiles generated by painting boxes either high or low
   reflectance colors could have significant ecophysiological consequences
   for animals occupying boxes, with animals in dark-green boxes at high
   risk of acute heat-stress and dehydration during extreme heat events.
   Conversely in cold weather, our modelling indicated that there are
   higher cumulative energy costs for mammals, particularly smaller
   animals, occupying light-green boxes. Given their widespread use as a
   conservation tool, we suggest that before boxes are installed,
   consideration should be given to the effect of color on nest box
   temperature profiles, and the resultant thermal suitability of boxes for
   wildlife, particularly during extremes in weather. Managers of nest box
   programs should consider using several different colors and installing
   boxes across a range of both orientations and shade profiles (i.e.,
   levels of canopy cover), to ensure target animals have access to
   artificial hollows with a broad range of thermal profiles, and can
   therefore choose boxes with optimal thermal conditions across different
   seasons.},

Journal = {ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Mestocin receptor concentrations in membrane preparations from
   reproductive tissues of the tammar Macropus eugenii throughout gestation
   and lactation were assessed using {[}H-3]-oxytocin as the ligand. There
   was a single binding site which bound both mesotocin and oxytocin with
   high and similar affinities. Mesotocin receptor concentrations in the
   myometrium were low (708 +/- 199 fmol mg(-1) protein) in early and
   middle gestation but increased significantly on day 23 of pregnancy of
   the 26-day gestation period to 1921 +/- 552 fmol mg(-1) protein.
   Myometrial receptors reached a peak of 2483 +/- 575 fmol mg(-1) protein
   on days 25 and 26 of gestation, but returned to basal levels about an
   hour after birth, Receptor concentrations in the contralateral
   non-gravid uterus were much lower (605 +/- 75 fmol mg-l) and did not
   significantly increase throughout the period of gestation but dropped
   one day before birth, Mesotocin receptors were undetectable in the
   endometrium, the yolk sac placenta and the lateral, median and anterior
   vagina of all animals tested. In the lactating mammary gland after birth
   mesotocin receptors were initially high (588 +/- 38 fmol mg-l) but
   decreased after 200 days and by late lactation were 224 +/- 55 fmol
   mg(-1) protein on day 240, close to the time of weaning. Mesotocin
   receptors in the ipsilateral non-lactating gland were also high in early
   lactation (430 +/- 153 fmol mg-l) and declined in late lactation (62 +/-
   20 fmol mg-l). The changing concentrations of mesotocin receptors in
   pregnancy and lactation demonstrate that they are specifically regulated
   in tammar reproductive tissues. The increase in mesotocin receptors in
   gravid, but non-gravid myometrium three days before birth may make the
   uterus responsive to the surge of mesotocin at. birth, Since this rise
   is unilateral and only occurs in the gravid myometrium it must be due to
   local effects from the ipsilateral ovary or the fete-placental unit.
   Likewise, the down-regulation of mesotocin receptors in the
   contralateral, non-gravid myometrium may be due to its proximity to the
   developing follicle. The changing concentrations in the lactating and
   the adjacent, non-lactating mammary gland also reflect a differential
   regulation of mesotocin receptors. probably mediated via the sucking
   stimulus. Thus, local influences appear to be of primary importance in
   the regulation of mesotocin receptors during reproduction in this
   marsupial. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {Egg and embryo coats of marsupials are reviewed. Marsupial eggs are
   enclosed by a zona pellucida, mucoid coat and an outer shell coat. An
   extra-cellular matrix coat that lines the zona pellucida also occurs in
   some species. The zona pellucida consists of three zona proteins (ZPA,
   ZPB, ZPC) with considerable similarity to those of eutherian mammals.
   The zona is thought to be the sperm receptor site and, in some species,
   but not others, is a barrier to polyspermy. Immunostaining, in situ
   hybridisation, histochemistry and electron microscopy indicate that the
   zona originates in the oocyte at the onset of oocyte growth. It changes
   greatly in shape during ovulation and early development and plays an
   essential role in blastocyst formation. The mucoid coat is an acid
   glycoprotein that is produced by non-ciliated cells at all levels of the
   oviduct and has been implicated in providing a barrier to polyspermy,
   nourishment of the embryo and an osmotically stable environment for the
   embryo. Its width varies widely in marsupials. The shell coat is
   secreted by the epithelia of the utero-tubal junction and upper uterus
   during oestrus and early cleavage. Evidence is provided for a second
   wave of secretion at bilaminar and trilaminar blastocyst stages.
   Shell-free embryos do not survive in vitro during bilaminar and early
   trilaminar blastocyst stages. Hatching from the shell coal occurs
   between 65 and 85\% of the gestation period usually when the embryo is
   undergoing early somitogenesis. The extra-cellular matrix is secreted by
   the oocyte or by the cells of early cleavage stages and initially
   separates cells from the zona pellucida and from each other. It plays an
   essential role in blastocyst formation. The zona, mucoid and shell coats
   provide a framework for blastocyst construction and normal embryos do
   not form in their absence in some species.

Title = {Towards a ZP-Based contraceptive for marsupials:: Comparative analysis

Abstract = {Fertility control in the form of a zona pellucida (ZP)-based
   immunocontraceptive has shown potential as a humane form of control for
   overabundant marsupials including the brushtail possum and macropods.
   Further refinement and development of a ZP-based vaccine requires
   detailed knowledge of the protein structure and expression in order to
   ensure maximum efficacy and specificity. Sequencing and comparative
   analysis of the ZP3 protein from three marsupial orders in this study
   found a high overall level of conservation; within order Diprotodontia,
   the ZP3 protein is 86.9-98.9\% identical. ZP3 identity falls to
   56.6-57.2\%, when the grey, short-tailed opossum (a Didelphimorphian) is
   compared to dasyurid and diprotodontan marsupials. This is similar to
   its amino acid identity with ZP3 from eutherian species (50.7-52.8\%).
   Comparison of a 21 amino acid epitope in marsupial ZP3 that has shown
   contraceptive effects, reveals 95-100\% identity between the four
   macropodid species, 81-86\% amino acid identity between brushtail possum
   and the macropods and 67-71\% identity between the diprotodontans and
   the fat-tailed dunnart (a dasyurid). This is comparable to the level of
   identity between related eutherian mammals. The expression pattern of
   three ZP genes during brushtail possum and tammar wallaby pouch young
   development was examined by RT-PCR. This analysis of ZP gene expression
   has confirmed that ZP mRNA transcription begins in the ovary during
   pouch young development by about 51 days of age. The presence of ZP
   transcripts at this stage in pouch young development suggests that
   marsupial ZP gene transcription begins before the onset of follicular
   development.},

Title = {Delayed return to estrus following treatment with the

   wallaby},
Journal = {THERIOGENOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {115},

Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists that induce a reversible
   contraceptive state in several marsupials have the potential to be used
   to synchronize estrus. We used a model macropod, the tammar wallaby
   (Notamacropus eugenii), to investigate whether Lucrin Depot (AbbVie), a
   GnRH agonist microsphere preparation, could (1) inhibit follicular
   development and estrus in a cycle reactivated by removal of pouch young
   (RPY) and (2) facilitate a synchronous return to estrus. Our results
   show that females reactivated with bromocriptine and RPY in early
   seasonal quiescence (July 2015) were inhibited by Lucrin Depot
   (0.125-0.5 mg kg(-1), n = 9) and unlike control females (n = 3), did not
   copulate before Day 32 RPY. During the next breeding season (February
   2016), the return to estrus after RPY was not delayed in animals treated
   with Lucrin Depot (<= 0.20 mg kg(-1); n = 12), and copulation occurred
   in treated and control females within the expected natural period after
   RPY (Day 26-33 RPY). In the following breeding season (March 2017),
   estrus was delayed in animals treated with Lucrin Depot (1.25 mg kg(-1))
   on either Day 0 (Group A, n = 6) or Day 10 (Group B, n = 6) after RPY
   compared to control females (n = 6). Estrus was detected in Group A
   between 39 and 66 days (55 +/- 4.8d) and in Group B between 43 and 71
   days (55.2 +/- 3.9d) after RPY. In contrast, all control females
   underwent estrus and copulated as expected by Day 30 RPY. We conclude
   Lucrin Depot can inhibit ovarian follicular activity after RPY but as a
   standalone treatment does not result in a highly synchronous return to
   estrus in the tammar wallaby. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {123},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this review, the biochemical composition and structural organization
   of the marsupial and eutherian zonae pellucidae are compared.
   Differences between the zonae from these two groups of mammals are
   observed in their response to dilute proteases and reducing agents, in
   their potential glycosylation patterns, and in some of their functions.
   However, studies on the glycoconjugates and polypeptides of the three
   zona pellucida genes have not explained these different responses to the
   proteases and reducing agents. There is high sequence similarity between
   the zona polypeptides of marsupials and eutherians, as well as a
   similarity in the oligosaccharides present, as demonstrated by lectin
   staining. As the marsupial and eutherian lineages diverged from a common
   ancestor over 100 million years ago, these observations indicate that
   the three-dimensional structure of these glycoproteins is highly
   conserved throughout all mammals, although the complexity of its
   molecular organization has yet to be resolved. Phylogenetic analyses
   indicate that there are at least four groups of paralogous zona
   pellucida genes in vertebrates. The marsupial ZPA and ZPB genes have
   been named in accordance with their orthologues but the phylogenetic
   relationships of the marsupial ZPC gene require further investigation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the response of a marsupial, the
   tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) to repeated superovulation and
   surgical oocyte collection and monitor any effects on subsequent natural
   breeding ability. Animals (n=5 per group) were superovulated once, twice
   or three times with pig FSH (pFSH; 6 mg administered twice per day for 4
   days) followed by 4 mg pig LH (pLH). There was an interval of either 5-6
   weeks (n=9) or 12 weeks (n=1) between the first and second
   superovulation and 13-17 weeks (n=5) between the second and third
   superovulation. Oocytes were collected surgically after each treatment.
   Serum was collected at the time of each treatment to monitor the
   formation of anti-pFSH and anti-pLH antibodies. Animals were allowed to
   mate naturally in the season following superovulation treatment(s).
   There was no significant difference between groups in the number of
   large follicles (2-5 mm diameter, mean standard error) produced in
   response to the first (21.2 +/- 4.3), second (18.0 +/- 6.5) or third
   (29.0 +/- 4.9) superovulation treatment. Eggs were recovered from
   approximately 80\% of follicles that were flushed during laparotomy.
   There were significant concentrations of anti-pFSH and anti-pLH
   antibodies (P < 0.05) detected in previously superovulated animals at
   the time of the second superovulation but not at the time of the third
   superovulation. The antigonadotrophin antibodies present at the time of
   repeated superovulation did not cause a significant decrease in average
   number of follicles. All animals produced pouch young in the breeding
   seasons after repeated superovulation. Combined with other reproductive
   technologies, repeated superovulation has the potential to increase the
   production of offspring from rare or valuable marsupials in captivity.},

Abstract = {The effect of the exogenous administration of porcine
   follicle-stimulating hormone ( pFSH) and pregnant mare serum
   gonadotrophin ( PMSG) on ovarian follicular development and oocyte
   maturation in the southern hairy nosed wombat Lasiorhinus latifrons was
   investigated. Three experimental groups were administered pFSH at
   various doses and for different treatment lengths, followed by 25 mg
   porcine luteinising hormone (pLH) 12 h after the last dose of pFSH.
   Another group was given PMSG followed 72 h later by 25 mg pLH. Animals
   were killed 24 h after pLH. The left ovary was fixed for histology and
   the morphology of the antral follicles was determined, whereas
   follicular oocytes in the right ovary were aspirated, fixed, stained
   with 4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and viewed for nuclear maturation.
   There was no significant difference in the mean number of ovarian
   follicles > 1 mm, or in the size class of follicles assessed between
   control and experimental groups. However, a trend was observed
   suggesting a possible increase in follicles > 3.0 mm in experimental
   groups compared with control animals. In all females administered
   exogenous porcine gonadotrophins, but not controls, some of the mural
   granulosa cells of large tertiary antral follicles had markedly enlarged
   nuclei ( approximately 14 mu m in diameter). All oocytes from the
   control group remained at the germinal vesicle stage, whereas
   approximately 40\% of oocytes retrieved from the pFSH groups and 82.4\%
   retrieved from the PMSG-primed animals had undergone germinal vesicle
   break down, with a small number reaching meiosis II. The present study
   shows that exogenous administration of either pFSH or PMSG to hairy
   nosed wombats can induce follicular growth and oocyte maturation. Such
   findings could be useful in the development of reproductive technology
   in this species.},

Abstract = {Components of assisted reproduction technologies (ART), such as sperm
   cryopreservation, artificial insemination, superovulation and pouch
   young surrogacy, have been developed for a range of Australian and
   American marsupials. However, methods to effectively control ovarian
   function, arguably the key limiting factors in applying and integrating
   ART as a practical tool in conservation management, remain poorly
   developed. This is largely due to unique characteristics of the
   marsupial corpus luteum and its failure to respond to agents used to
   synchronize ovarian function in eutherian mammals. This paper presents
   an overview of relevant aspects of marsupial reproductive biology across
   marsupial taxonomic groups including information on the long-established
   technique of removal of suckling young to activate ovarian cycles.
   Ovarian monitoring tools for marsupials are reviewed and their
   usefulness for ART assessed (laparotomy, hormone cycling, vaginal
   cytology, laparoscopy and ultrasonography). We also discuss promising
   recent work examining the potential of manipulating
   hypothalamic-pituitary function using GnRH agonists and antagonists as
   the basis of ovarian control (female synchronization) strategies. (C)

Abstract = {Contraceptive vaccines can be designed to inhibit (i) production of the
   gametes (sperm and oocyte), (ii) functions of gametes leading to block
   in fertilization, and (iii) the gamete outcome (pregnancy). The zona
   pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins have been proposed as candidates for
   developing contraceptive vaccines by virtue of their critical role in
   fertilization. Immunization of non-human primates with either native or
   recombinant ZP proteins leads to curtailment of fertility, which however
   is invariably associated with ovarian pathology. To avoid oophoritis,
   immunogens corresponding to mapped B cell epitopes of ZP proteins that
   are devoid of `oophoritogenic' T cell epitopes have been proposed.
   However, ways to overcome the observed oophoritis associated with the
   ZP-based contraceptive vaccines are yet to be fully defined. This is
   essential if their use for control of human fertility is to be
   considered. Nonetheless, contraceptive vaccines based on ZP proteins
   have shown very promising results in controlling wildlife population
   such as wild horses, white-tailed deers, elephants, marsupials, grey
   seals and dogs, where long term infertility or even permanent sterility
   is desirable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Does habitat fragmentation cause stress in the agile antechinus? A
   haematological approach},

Abstract = {Although the vertebrate stress response is essential for survival,
   frequent or prolonged stress responses can result in chronic
   physiological stress, which is associated with a suite of conditions
   that can impair survivorship and reproductive output. Anthropogenic
   habitat fragmentation and degradation are potential stressors of
   free-living vertebrates, and in theory could result in chronic stress.
   To address this issue, we compared haematological indicators of stress
   and condition in agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis) populations in 30
   forest fragments and 30 undisturbed, continuous forest sites
   (pseudofragments) in south-eastern Australia over 2 years. In peripheral
   blood, the total leucocyte count was lower and the neutrophil/lymphocyte
   ratio and percentage of eosinophils in the total leucocyte population
   was higher in fragment than pseudofragment populations, indicating that
   fragment populations were probably experiencing higher levels of stress
   hormone-mediated and/or parasite infection-related chronic physiological
   stress. The total erythrocyte count and haematocrit were higher and mean
   erythrocyte haemoglobin content was lower in fragment than
   pseudofragment populations. This suggests that fragment populations
   showed possible signs of regenerative anaemia, a syndrome associated
   with elevated hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis mediated stress.
   However, mean erythrocyte volume was also lower in fragments, and red
   blood cell distribution width did not differ between the study
   populations, findings which were not consistent with this diagnosis.
   Whole blood and mean cell haemoglobin concentrations were similar in
   fragment and pseudofragment populations. We suggest that where
   anthropogenic activity results in habitat fragmentation and degradation,
   chronic stress could contribute to a decline in agile antechinus
   populations. The broader implication is that chronic stress could be
   both symptomatic of, and contributing to, decline of some vertebrate
   populations in anthropogenically fragmented and degraded habitats.},

Title = {Could recombinant technology facilitate the realisation of a
   fertility-control vaccine for possums?},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-111},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While lethal control remains the primary tool for possum control in New
   Zealand, there has been substantial research effort over the last decade
   into controlling possum populations by reducing the animals' breeding
   potential. In particular, the potential of immunological control to
   reduce fertility has been investigated, whereby the possums' immune
   system is induced to react against its reproductive system, in order to
   block or destroy key components of the reproductive process. Two of the
   most targeted key components have been the blocking of circulating
   hormones (e. g. gonadotrophin-releasing hormone) and the inhibition of
   functional egg surface proteins (e. g. zona pellucida). While some
   success has been achieved for each approach, three main obstacles remain
   to the development of a working fertility-control vaccine for possums:
   first, ensuring that the vaccine remains efficacious in oral-delivery
   formulation; second, ensuring sufficient levels of fertility reduction;
   and third, ensuring that the induced immune response is sustained for a
   duration sufficient for long-term suppression of reproduction. The use
   of a genetically modified recombinant organism (parasite, bacterium or
   virus) to deliver a fertility-control vaccine could satisfy these
   requirements. A strong precedent for this approach has been set already
   in wildlife biology, namely the oral rabies vaccine, which is based on a
   recombinant vaccinia virus and which has been used successfully for the
   last 25 years as a disease-eliminating vaccine in mesocarnivores in
   Europe and North America. This review outlines the different forms and
   examples of recombinant organisms with potential for engineering into
   recombinant fertility-control vaccines to reduce possum reproduction;
   non-transmissible agents or fully-transmissible vectors are discussed,
   with shortcomings and benefits outlined for each.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {159-178},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Three basic forms of management strategies exist for wildlife disease,
   as follows: prevention of introduction of disease, control of existing
   disease or eradication. Management may be directed at the disease agent,
   host population, habitat or be focused on human activities. Disease
   agents may be dealt with in the environment through disinfection or in
   the host through treatment. Disinfection and pesticides used to destroy
   agents or vectors are limited to local situations, may have serious
   environmental effects and may result in acquired resistance. Difficulty
   in delivering treatment limits chemotherapy to local situations. Host
   populations may be managed by immunisation, by altering their
   distribution or density, or by extirpation. Immunisation is best suited
   for microparasitic exogenous infections with a low reproductive rate and
   in populations which have a low turnover. Mass immunisation with oral
   baits has been effective, but this strategy is limited to a few serious
   diseases. It is difficult to move wild animals and techniques to
   discourage animals from entering an area become ineffective rapidly. The
   setting up of fences is feasible only in local situations. Selective
   culling is limited to situations in which affected individuals are
   readily identifiable. General population reduction has had little
   success in disease control but reducing populations surrounding a focus
   or creating a barrier to disease movement have been successful.
   Population reduction is a temporary measure. Eradication of a wildlife
   population has not been attempted for disease management. Habitat
   modification may be used to reduce exposure to disease agents, or to
   alter host distribution or density. Management of diseases of wild
   animals usually requires a change in human activities. The most
   important method is by restricting translocation of wild animals to
   prevent movement of disease.},

Year = {2006},

Abstract = {The mammalian zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding
   oocytes and early embryos, which is critical for normal fertilization
   and preimplantation development. It is made up of three/four
   glycoproteins arranged in a delicate filamentous matrix. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) studies have shown that ZP has a porous,
   net-like structure and/ or nearly smooth and compact aspect. In this
   study, the fine 3-D structure of the human and mouse ZP is reviewed with
   the aim to integrate ultrastructural and molecular data, considering
   that the mouse is still used as a good model for human fertilization. By
   conventional SEM observations, numerous evidences support that the
   spongy ZP appearance well correlates with mature oocytes. When observed
   through more sophisticated techniques at high resolution SEM, ZP showed
   a delicate meshwork of thin interconnected filaments, in a regular
   alternating pattern of wide and tight meshes. In mature oocytes, the
   wide meshes correspond to ``pores{''} of the ``spongy{''} ZP, whereas
   the tight meshes correspond to the compact parts of the ZP surrounding
   the pores. In conclusion, the traditional ``spongy{''} or ``compact{''}
   appearance of the ZP at conventional SEM appears to be only the
   consequence of a prevalence of different arrangements of microfilament
   networks, according to the maturation stage of the oocyte, and in
   agreement with the modern supramolecular model of the ZP at the basis of
   egg-sperm recognition. Despite great differences in molecular
   characterization of ZP glycoproteins between human and mouse ZP, there
   are no differences in the 3-D organization of glycoproteic
   microfilaments in these species.},

   at which time the naturally cycling females had already ovulated; at day
   16 females had no antral follicles, but by day 20 antral follicles had
   begun to develop. There was no difference between naturally cycling
   breeding and retired females. Females were stimulated with 1 IU equine
   serum gonadotropin (eSG) during the intermediate phase on day 16 and
   killed 3, 4, or 5 days later. Stimulation resulted in a significant
   increase in the number of growing antral follicles but retired females
   demonstrated a reduced response. Upon collection from breeding females 4
   days following eSG stimulation, 100\% of oocytes were at the first polar
   body (PB1) stage, those collected from retired females were immature
   upon collection but within 48 h 98.2 +/- 1.9\% were cultured to the PB1
   stage. The rate of ovulation was high in breeding females 5 days
   following stimulation but retired females were less reliable, and in
   both groups all oocytes were degraded. This is the first study to
   describe a reliable technique, involving ovarian stimulation during the
   intermediate phase and segregation of age groups, allowing the
   collection of a large number of healthy PB1 stage oocytes from S.
   crassicaudata. This is important for the development of further assisted
   reproductive techniques for this species and threatened dasyurids.

Abstract = {A primary goal of evolutionary biology is to identify the factors that
   shape phenotypic evolution. According to the theory of natural
   selection, phenotypic evolution occurs through the differential survival
   and reproduction of individuals whose traits are selectively
   advantageous relative to other individuals in the population. This
   implies that evolution by natural selection is contingent upon the
   distribution and magnitude of phenotypic variation among individuals,
   which are in turn the products of developmental processes. Development
   therefore has the potential to affect the trajectory and rate of
   phenotypic evolution. Recent research in diverse systems (e.g.,
   mammalian teeth, cichlid skulls, butterfly wings, and marsupial limbs)
   supports the hypothesis that development biases phenotypic variation and
   evolution, but suggests that these biases might be system-specific. J.

Abstract = {Most woody plants contain a diverse array of plant secondary metabolites
   (PSMs) that deter vertebrate herbivores. However, mammalian folivores
   have evolved a complex of physiological and behavioural strategies to
   counter these compounds, leading to the development of an ``evolutionary
   arms race{''}. Marsupial folivores are ideal models to investigate the
   role of PSMs in the interaction between the external foraging
   environment and the digestive physiology of mammalian herbivores, as we
   have a very strong understanding of the diversity and modes of action of
   PSMs in Eucalyptus, as well as the mechanisms by which animals overcome
   the effects of these compounds. Studies of marsupial folivores have
   benefited from the facts that: these herbivores subsist on relatively
   poor quality diets; they include feeding types from specialist species
   such as the koala, to generalists; and life history factors such as
   maternal investment in reproduction can be measured more easily than in
   eutherians. Here, we describe patterns of spatial variation in the types
   and distributions of plant secondary metabolites in Australian forests
   and discuss how this variation influences foraging behaviour, habitat
   selection and life history strategies in arboreal, folivorous
   marsupials. We also provide a summary of our understanding of the
   mechanisms by which marsupials detect and regulate their intake of toxic
   compounds. While our examples are drawn largely from studies of the
   interaction between marsupials and Eucalyptus, this knowledge is
   applicable to advancing our understanding of interactions in
   plant-mammal systems more broadly. We also identify and discuss key
   areas that should be the focus of future research.},

Title = {Immunogenetics of marsupial B-cells},
Journal = {MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marsupials and eutherians are mammals that differ in their physiological
   traits, predominately their reproductive and developmental strategies;
   eutherians give birth to well-developed young, while marsupials are born
   highly altricial after a much shorter gestation. These developmental
   traits also result in differences in the development of the immune
   system of eutherian and marsupial species. In eutherians, B-cells are
   the key to humoral immunity as they are found in multiple lymphoid
   organs and have the unique ability to mediate the production of
   antigen-specific antibodies in the presence of extracellular pathogens.
   The development of B-cells in marsupials has been reported and
   hypothesised to be similar to that of eutherians, except that
   haematopoiesis occurs in the liver, postpartum, until the bone marrow
   fully matures. In eutherians, specific genes are linked to specific
   stages in B-cell development, maturation, and differentiation processes,
   and have been identified including immunoglobulins (heavy and light
   chains), cluster of differentiation markers (CD10, 19, 34 and CD79
   alpha/beta), signal transduction molecules (BTK, Lyn and Syk) and
   transcriptional regulators (EBF1, E2A, and Pax5). This review aims to
   discuss the known similarities and differences between marsupial and
   eutherian B-cells, in regards to their genetic presence, homology, and
   developmental stages, as well as to highlight the areas requiring
   further investigation. By enhancing our understanding of the genes that
   are involved with B-cells in the marsupial lineage, it will, in turn,
   aid our understanding of the marsupial immune system and support the
   development of specific immunological reagents for research and wildlife
   conservation purposes.},

Abstract = {In placental (eutherian) mammals, a number of important events take
   place within the oviduct including the pre-fertilisation maturation of
   gametes (including sperm storage), sperm-egg interactions, egg
   activation and early embryonic development. Many of these events involve
   interactions of glycoconjugates; both on the surface of the gametes and
   with the secretions of the oviductal epithelium and these have best been
   studied in eutherian mammals. In marsupials, however, while the oviduct
   is known to produce the extracellular egg coat, the mucoid layer, that
   comes to surround the zona pellucida, its role in the maturation of
   gametes is only now being elucidated, particularly in the oocyte. This
   review emphasises what is known of the structure and function of the
   oviduct and its secretions in marsupials and briefly compares it with
   data from eutherians. In particular, knowledge of oviductal
   glycoconjugates in the structure of the post-ovulatory oocyte and its
   vestments around the time of fertilisation in Australian marsupials is
   outlined.},

Abstract = {Differences among populations in the intensity of sexual selection
   resulting from distinct genetic mating systems can lead to divergent
   morphological evolution and speciation. However, little is known about
   how genetic mating systems vary between populations and what factors may
   contribute to this variation. In this study, we compare the genetic
   mating systems of two geographically distinct populations of the dusky
   pipefish (Syngnathus floridae), a species characterized by polygynandry
   and male pregnancy, from the Atlantic Coast of Virginia and the Gulf
   Coast of Florida. Our results revealed significant interpopulation
   variation in mating and reproductive success. Estimates of the
   opportunity for selection (I), the opportunity for sexual selection
   (I-s) and the Bateman gradient (beta(ss)) were higher among males in the
   Florida population than in the Virginia population, suggesting that
   sexual selection on males is stronger in the Florida population. The
   Virginia population is larger and denser than the Florida population,
   suggesting that population demographics may be one of many causal
   factors shaping interpopulational mating patterns. This study also
   provides evidence that the adult sex ratio, operational sex ratio,
   population density and genetic mating system of S. floridae may be
   temporally stable over timescales of a month in the Florida population.
   Overall, our results show that this species is a good model for the
   study of mating system variation in nature and that Bateman's principles
   may be a useful technique for the quantitative comparison of mating
   systems between populations.},

Abstract = {The goal for fertility control of animal populations is the development
   of a safe, economical and effective contraceptive. One offshoot of the
   development of this technology is the acquisition of multiple
   therapeutic strategies for diseases, such as immunotherapy probes for
   cancer. In the long run, successful population control requires
   multifactorial strategies. One component of population control is
   immunocontraception. Development of effective antigens for
   immunocontraceptive vaccines has been remarkable and has greatly
   advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fertilization.
   The chasm between the discovery of an antigen in the laboratory, to the
   implementation of an effective field program, is immense. The zona
   pellucida (ZP) immunocontraceptive that has been most extensively
   evaluated as a fertility vaccine antigen and the porcine ZP has received
   particular attention. The long-term goal of population control would be
   the use of a synthetic vaccine, e.g. the ZP, tailored to a target
   species. In the future, if populations' levels are to be controlled by
   fertility vaccines, we should consider that the vaccinated animals could
   receive other health protective agents at the same time. For example, if
   a species were immunocontracepted, then they could be simultaneously
   vaccinated against habitat diseases such as rabies (Plumb et al., Rev
   Sci Tech, 26, 2007, 229).},

Abstract = {The oxytocic peptide mesotocin was measured in plasma samples collected
   throughout pregnancy in the conscious tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii.
   Plasma mesotocin and the prostaglandin metabolite
   13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-prostaglandin F-2 alpha were also assessed
   immediately prepartum and during parturition. A radioimmunoassay for
   mesotocin was validated in the tammar and this assay allowed direct
   measurement in 50 mu l unextracted plasma with a sensitivity of 12.5
   pmol l(-1). Plasma concentrations of mesotocin remained basal
   (approximately 15 pmol l(-1)) at all stages of pregnancy, including
   prepartum A significant (P < 0.05) increase in plasma mesotocin was
   observed only immediately after delivery of the neonate and this
   increase was maintained for at least 15 min postpartum. Mesotocin
   concentrations returned to basal values 2 h after birth. Peak
   concentrations of mesotocin of 516.7 +/- 108.1 pmol l(-1) were measured
   within 2 min of birth. This peak coincided with a short-lived peak in
   concentration of prostaglandin F-2 alpha metabolite immediately after
   birth (2.1 +/- 0.4 nmol l(-1)) which decreased to less than 0.3 nmol
   l(-1) within 2 h postpartum These data demonstrate that mesotocin is
   released during, or immediately after, delivery and appears to parallel
   the profile of circulating prostaglandin F-2 alpha metabolite in this
   marsupial.},

Title = {Embryo-endometrial interactions during early development after embryonic
   diapause in the marsupial tammar wallaby},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2-4},
Pages = {175-181},
Abstract = {The marsupial tammar wallaby has the longest period of embryonic
   diapause of any mammal. Reproduction in the tammar is seasonal,
   regulated by photoperiod and also lactation. Reactivation is triggered
   by falling daylength after the austral summer solstice in December.
   Young are born late January and commence a 9-10-month lactation. Females
   mate immediately after birth. The resulting conceptus develops over 6- 7
   days to form a unilaminar blastocyst of 80-100 cells and enters
   lactationally, and later seasonally, controlled diapause. The proximate
   endocrine signal for reactivation is an increase in progesterone which
   alters uterine secretions. Since the diapausing blastocyst is surrounded
   by the zona and 2 other acellular coats, the mucoid layer and shell
   coat, the uterine signals that maintain or terminate diapause must
   involve soluble factors in the secretions rather than any direct
   cellular interaction between uterus and embryo. Our studies suggest
   involvement of a number of cytokines in the regulation of diapause in
   tammars. The endometrium secretes platelet activating factor (PAF) and
   leukaemia inhibitory factor, which increase after reactivation.
   Receptors for PAF are low on the blastocyst during diapause but are
   upregulated at reactivation. Conversely, there is endometrial expression
   of the muscle segment homeobox gene MSX2 throughout diapause, but it is
   rapidly downregulated at reactivation. These patterns are consistent
   with those observed in diapausing mice and mink after reactivation,
   despite the very different patterns of endocrine control of diapause in
   these 3 divergent species. These common patterns suggest a similar
   underlying mechanism for diapause, perhaps common to all mammals, but
   which is activated in only a few.},

Title = {Mutualisms with the wreckage of an avifauna: the status of bird
   pollination and fruit-dispersal in New Zealand},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {66-85},
Abstract = {Worldwide declines in bird numbers have recently renewed interest in how
   well bird-plant mutualisms are functioning. In New Zealand, it has been
   argued that bird pollination was relatively unimportant and
   bird-pollination failure was unlikely to threaten any New Zealand
   plants, whereas dispersal mutualisms were widespread and in some cases
   potentially at risk because of reliance on a single large frugivore, the
   kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae). Work since 1989, however, has
   changed that assessment. Smaller individual fruits of most plant species
   can be dispersed by mid-sized birds such as tui (Prosthemadera
   novaezelandiae) because both fruits and birds vary in size within a
   species. Only one species (Bedschmiedia tarairi) has no individual
   fruits small enough for this to occur. Germination of 19 fleshy-fruited
   species, including most species with fruits >8 mm diameter, does not
   depend on birds removing the fruit pulp. The few studies of fruit
   removal rates mostly (7 out of 10) show good dispersal quantity. So
   dispersal is less at risk than once thought. In contrast, there is now
   evidence for widespread pollen limitation in species with ornithophilous
   flowers. Tests on 10 of the 29 known native ornithophilous-flowered
   species found that in 8 cases seed production was reduced by at least
   one-third, and the pollen limitation indices overall were significantly
   higher than the global average. Birds also frequently visit flowers of
   many other smaller-flowered native species, and excluding birds
   significantly reduced seed set in the three species tested. So
   pollination is more at risk than once thought. Finally, analyses of both
   species numbers and total woody basal area show that dependence on bird
   pollination is unexpectedly high. Birds have been recorded visiting the
   flowers of 85 native species, representing 5\% of the total seed-plant
   flora (compared with 12\% of those with fleshy fruit) and 30\% of the
   tree flora (compared with 59\% with fleshy fruit). A higher percentage
   of New Zealand forest basal area has bird-visited flowers (37\% of basal
   area nationally) than fleshy fruit (31\%). Thus, bird pollination is
   more important in New Zealand than was realised, partly because birds
   visit many flowers that do not have classic ``ornithophilous{''} flower
   morphology.},

Abstract = {Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced by the neurohypophysis. The
   discovery that the peptide is produced locally within the male and
   female reproductive tracts has raised the possibility that oxytocin may
   have paracrine and autocrine actions outside of the nervous system.
   Oxytocin and its receptor have been identified in the human prostate.
   The prostate is an androgen-dependent organ whose function is to secrete
   components of the seminal fluid. Oxytocin has been shown to modulate
   contractility of prostate tissue and also to regulate local
   concentrations of the biologically active androgens. Oxytocin has also
   been shown to regulate cell growth. Prostate disease is common and
   results from abnormal growth of the gland. Oxytocin concentrations are
   altered in both benign and malignant prostate diseases and in vitro
   studies suggest that the peptide may be involved in the pathophysiology
   of these diseases.},

Title = {Evolution of milk oligosacharides and lactose},

Abstract = {Living mammals comprise monotremes, marsupials and eutherians (placental
   mammals). These three Infraclasses, although they differ markedly in
   their patterns of reproduction, have in common the phenomenon of
   lactation, i.e. the production of milk by the female subsequent to
   hatching (monotremes) or birth (marsupials, eutherians).
   The dominant carbohydrate in the milk of most eutherians is the
   disaccharide lactose, whose synthesis by the lactating mammary gland is
   catalysed by lactose synthase, which is a complex consisting of
   beta4galactosyltransferase I and alpha-lactalbumin. alpha-Lactalbumin is
   found only in mammals and is believed to have evolved from lysozyme, an
   ancient protein which is widely distributed in the animal kingdom. The
   alpha-lactalbumin content within the mammary gland is the controlling
   factor determining the rate of lactose synthesis.
   The dominant carbohydrates in the milk of monotremes and marsupials and
   of a few eutherian species are oligosaccharides, i.e. sugars which
   consist of three or more monosaccharide residues. The milk and colostrum
   of humans and of some other eutherians also contains significant amounts
   of oligosaccharides. Milk oligosaccharide synthesis is catalysed by a
   variety of glycosyltransferases which transfer monosaccharide residues
   (galactosyl, fucosyl, sialyl or N-acetylglucosaminyl) either to free
   lactose or to another monosaccharide residue attached to lactose. In
   terms of chemical structures, eutherian and monotreme oligosaccharides
   resemble each other whereas the marsupial oligosaccharides are mostly
   unique, but almost all contain lactose at their reducing ends.
   Milk oligosaccharides are now recognised as being very significant as
   anti-microbial compounds against pathogenic microorganisms as well as
   being an energy source for the young of monotremes and marsupials. Milk
   oligosaccharides may also provide specific monosaccharides which are
   required for the postnatal biosynthesis of glycoconjugates, particularly
   of the nervous system.
   We propose the following hypothesis for the evolution of milk
   oligosaccharides. The primitive mammary glands of the first common
   ancestor of mammals contained lysozyme and a variety of
   glycosyltransferases but little or no alpha-lactalbumin. When
   alpha-lactalbumin first appeared, its content within the lactating
   mammary glands was low and lactose was synthesised at a relatively slow
   rate. Because of the presence of glycosyl transferases, almost all of
   the lactose was utilised for the synthesis of oligosaccharides and did
   not accumulate, its steady-state concentration remaining low.
   Consequently the predominant saccharides in the proto-lacteal secretions
   or milk produced by this common ancestor were oligosaccharides and not
   free lactose.
   Initially, the oligosaccharides served mainly as anti-infection factors
   against pathogenic organisms. They were then recruited as an energy
   source for the neonates, and natural selection favoured an increase in
   their concentration. This was achieved by an increase in the synthesis
   of alpha-lactalbumin and possibly also of the glycosyltransferases. The
   two biological roles of anti-infection and provision of energy were
   preserved in both monotremes and marsupials but in most eutherians the
   milk concentration of free lactose increased due to a significant
   increase in alpha-lactalbumin synthesis by the mammary gland. Lactose
   therefore became a significant energy source for most eutherians while
   oligosaccharides continued to serve mainly as anti-microbial agents. The
   advent of milk lactose at relatively high concentrations necessitated
   the prior evolution or co-evolution of brush border small intestinal
   lactase, which provided an efficient mechanism for the digestion of
   lactose.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of three exogenous gonadotrophin
   regimens on ovarian follicular development in southern hairy-nosed
   wombats during the non-breeding season. Females were given either
   porcine follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH; total of 200 mg at 12 h
   intervals over 7 (Group 1), or 4 days (Group 2)), or pregnant mares'
   serum gonadotrophin (PMSG; single dose of 150 I.U. (Group 3)). In all
   treatment groups 25 mg of porcine luteinising hormone (pLH) was used to
   trigger maturation; Groups I and 2 received pLH 12 It after the final
   pFSH injection and Group 3 received pLH 72 h after PMSG. The results
   showed Group I produced significantly more follicles per ovary (5.91 +/-
   1.28) than Group 2 (1.67 +/- 0.62), or Group 3 (2.17 +/- 1.16) at p <
   0.05. Control females received saline injections concurrently with the
   three treatment groups (n = 6; 2 control animals for each treatment
   group). No follicular development occurred in any control female.
   Analysis of oocyte nuclear status revealed that while oocytes from all
   three treatment groups had resumed meiosis, only those in Group I (7-day
   pFSH/pLH treatment) progressed to metaphase H. These results have
   implications for the development of assisted breeding strategies in this
   species. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article makes two points. First, the diprotodont marsupials,
   including the kangaroos, wallabies and the Australian possum are not
   primitive mammals, and their brains make as good a general model of the
   higher mammals such as monkeys and humans as do those of the more common
   laboratory mammals such as cats and rats. Second, the peculiarities of
   marsupial reproduction, which comprises a very short period of
   intrauterine development, followed by a relatively protracted period of
   development in the pouch, provide unparalleled advantages for research
   into mammalian neuroembryology. Examples will be provided of how such
   research has made a contribution to our understanding of neural
   development, concentrating primarily on the visual system.},

Abstract = {The Trivers-Willard hypothesis predicts that, in polygynous and sexually
   dimorphic mammals, mothers able to provide a large amount of care should
   produce more sons. Tests of this prediction, however, have generated
   equivocal results, possibly because multiple factors, including
   environmental conditions, simultaneously influence progeny sex ratio. We
   tested the influence of maternal mass, condition, size, previous
   reproduction and age class on offspring sex ratio in two populations of
   eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus). In one population, heavier
   and taller mothers produced more sons than did lighter mothers, but
   maternal condition had no effect on progeny sex ratio. Primiparous
   females, however, produced an even offspring sex ratio despite being
   smaller than multiparous females. A strong year effect on progeny sex
   ratio suggested a likely effect of environmental conditions. In the
   second population, none of the variables tested influenced progeny sex
   ratio. Different environmental conditions between the two populations
   could partly explain these results. Because maternal size and mass
   likely correlate with reproductive potential, we suggest that our
   results support the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, but other variables
   likely also influence progeny sex ratio.},

Abstract = {The zona pellucida glycoconjugate content of several marsupial species
   was investigated using differential lectin histochemistry. Ovaries from
   fat-tailed dunnarts, a southern brown bandicoot, grey short-tailed
   opossums, brushtail possums, ringtail possums, koalas and eastern grey
   kangaroos were fixed, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained
   with ten fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins. Sections were
   also incubated with either neuraminidase or saponified, respectively,
   before incubation with the lectins to identify saccharide residues
   masked by sialic acids or O-acetyl groups on sialic acids. The zonae
   pellucidae surrounding the oocytes of the marsupials demonstrated
   interspecific variation in glycoconjugate content, with
   mannose-containing glycoconjugates exhibiting the greatest variation.
   Some of the zona pellucida glycoconjugates of all species, except those
   of the opossums, were masked by sialic acid with an increase in
   fluorescence with lectins from Arachis hypogea (PNA), and Glycine max
   (SBA), after desialylation. The disaccharide
   beta-galactose(1-4)N-acetyl-D-glucosamine appeared to be
   conformationally masked by O-acetyl groups of sialic acids in the zonae
   pellucidae of all species, with an increase in fluorescence with the
   lectin from Erythrina cyistagalli (ECA), after saponification. Similar
   intensity and localization of beta-(1-4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, as
   shown by staining of the lectin from Triticum vulgaris (WGA), to the
   inner and outer regions of the zona pellucida, were found to those
   reported in eutherian species. WGA fluorescence became uniform
   throughout the zonae pellucidae after saponification, indicating
   differential O-acetylation of sialic acids on the internal compartment
   of the zonae pellucidae.},

Abstract = {Zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins, by virtue of their critical role in
   fertilization, have been proposed as candidate antigens for the
   development of contraceptive vaccines. In this review, the potential of
   a ZP-based contraceptive vaccine for the management of wildlife
   population, with special reference to street dogs, is discussed.
   Immunization of various animal species, including female dogs, with
   native porcine ZP led to inhibition of fertility, which was associated
   with the ovarian dysfunction. Immunization of female dogs with
   Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant dog ZP glycoprotein-3 (ZP3)
   either coupled to diphtheria toxoid or expressed as fusion protein with
   `promiscuous' T non-B-cell epitope of tetanus toxoid also led to
   inhibition of fertility. To improve the contraceptive efficacy of
   ZP-based contraceptive vaccine, various groups are working on improving
   the immunogen, use of DNA vaccine as prime-boost strategy, and
   delivering the zona proteins/peptides presented on either virus-like
   particles or entrapped in microsphere. Host-specific live vectors such
   as ectromelia virus and cytomegalovirus have also been used to deliver
   mouse ZP3 in mice. Various studies show the enormous potential of the
   ZP-based vaccine for the management of wildlife population, where
   permanent sterilization may be desirable.},

Abstract = {Unlike eutherian mammals which secrete only oxytocin (OT), marsupials
   secrete the typically reptilian mesotocin (MT) and/or OT as their
   oxytocic peptides. Our laboratories have been conducting research on
   various aspects of the roles of OT-like peptides in three marsupials,
   the brushtail possum, the northern brown bandicoot and the tammar
   wallaby. By providing information on the functions of OT-like peptides
   in these species we hope to provide some clues as to the evolution of
   neurohypophysial hormones in marsupials. Brain and peripheral
   distributions of OT-like peptides have been studied in the possum and
   bandicoot. As in eutherian mammals, OT-like peptides are distributed
   throughout the brain and are present in the testis, corpus luteum,
   prostate and adrenal glands. Studies on the regulation of release of MT
   into plasma in the possum show that it is regulated by similar
   mechanisms to OT release in eutherian mammals. OT receptors have been
   characterized and localized in the possum and the tissue distributions
   and pharmacological characteristics of the receptor are similar to both
   the sheep and rat OT receptors. The marsupial OT receptor shows no
   pharmacological specificity for MT over OT which is reflected in the
   similar potency of these peptides in eliciting contractions of the
   uterus of the tammar wallaby in vitro. MT seems to play an important but
   not essential role in parturition in the tammar. MT concentrations are
   increased immediately after delivery in the tammar but infusion of an OT
   antagonist before expected birth delays but does not prevent
   parturition. The presence of OT receptors in the marsupial mammary gland
   and the sensitivity of the gland to exogenous OT and stimulation of
   mesotocinergic neurones demonstrates that these peptides are important
   for marsupial lactation. Our data suggest that the presence of MT with
   or without OT in marsupials is a result of a neutral mutation rather
   than functional evolution.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on
   what is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the brushtail possum, and to
   report on the outcomes of attempts made to manipulate by hormonal means,
   these processes in the possum. Over the last 15 years, several unique
   features of possum reproductive physiology have been discovered. These
   include an extended follicular phase despite elevated concentrations of
   FSH during the luteal phase, and early expression of LH receptors on
   granulosa cells of small antral follicles, suggesting a different
   mechanism for the selection of a dominant follicle. The use of routine
   synchronisation protocols that are effective in eutherians has failed to
   be effective in possums, and so the ability to reliably synchronise
   oestrus in this species remains a challenge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Marsupial young are born in an under-developed state without mature
   immune responses. Prior to the maturation of an immune system, marsupial
   young are heavily reliant upon immune factors secreted in the milk to
   defend them against potential microbial pathogens in the environment. In
   this study, we identified and characterized the immunoglobulin heavy
   chain constant regions, light chains, polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), J
   chain, neonatal Fc receptor (alpha chain) (FcRn) and the chemokine CCL28
   from the model marsupial species, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii).
   Low levels of conservation were seen in motifs in C alpha and C gamma
   associated with receptor binding and or transcytosis, and this may have
   potential implications for functionality. We evaluated the expression of
   immunoglobulin genes in the tammar mammary gland throughout lactation
   and found that two periods of increased expression of irnmunoglobulin
   genes occur. These two periods coincide with the birth of the young, and
   with its first emergence from the pouch. This increased expression may
   represent a strategy for maternal immunological protection of the pouch
   young. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Adaptive adjustments in offspring sex ratios in mammals have long been
   reported, but the conditions and mechanisms that prompt shifts in the
   proportion of sons and daughters born are still unclear.
   Empirical evidence indicates that offspring sex in mammals can be
   related to a diversity of environmental and maternal traits. However,
   the underlying assumptions regarding offspring and maternal fitness are
   rarely tested.
   Physiological mechanisms of maternal selection of offspring sex may
   occur at many stages during the prolonged maternal investment stage, and
   a pluralistic approach to studying mechanisms might prove fruitful.
   This review highlights the apparent frequency, in marsupial mammals, of
   sex ratio bias, which has largely been recorded as conforming to one of
   a few hypotheses.
   Marsupials are ideally suited to experiments involving cross-fostering
   of offspring, which can allow rigorous tests of the fitness consequences
   of rearing one sex vs. the other. The reproductive biology of marsupials
   lends the group to detailed studies of the timing and physiological
   correlates of offspring sex biases.
   Many components of metatherian biology may prove advantageous in
   experimental studies of sex allocation in mammals, and together may
   provide a prosperous avenue for examining adaptive and mechanistic
   hypotheses in mammalian sex allocation.},

Abstract = {The world's population is continuing to grow at an alarming rate and yet
   no novel methods of contraception have been introduced since 1960s. The
   paucity of our current contraceptive armoury is indicated by the 46
   million abortions that are performed each year, largely in developing
   countries where population growth is greatest. Thus, whatever new forms
   of fertility control we develop for the next millennium, the particular
   needs of developing countries should be borne in mind. Contraceptive
   vaccines have the potential to provide safe, effective, prolonged,
   reversible protection against pregnancy in a form that can be easily
   administered in the Third World. In this review we consider the
   contraceptive targets that might be pursued, how vaccines might be
   engineered and the problems generated by inter-individual variations in
   antibody titre. We conclude that the specifications for a safe,
   effective, reversible vaccine are more likely to be met in animals than
   man. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},
